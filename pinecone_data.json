But its origins, they're shrouded in mystery. The genies that led to the creation of this iconic city were the first to come to the world. The genies that led to the creation of this iconic city started somewhere. Where there is an end, there is also a beginning, and I intend to find it. My name is Albert Lin, and I look at the world in a unique way. I use 21st century technologies to look back into the past. Check that out, I can actually fly through the secret ancient world.

It's an incredible feat of engineering, of design, of imagination. This royal city sits high above the sacred valley of Peru, South America. The Inca believed that these mountains were dots.

This is a separate rock from this rock, and yet they fit perfectly together. You couldn't fit even a razor blade between these two stones. And this was shaped with stone tools. This speaks to the monumental effort and genius of the Inca world. It's a masterpiece. What I'm trying to get to in this journey is how much peaches came to be. It wasn't a spark from nothing",

It says, when the Inca ruler passed by this area, he saw the shrine of Diracoche. The people told him the miracle of fire that fell from the sky. He decided that the remembrance should be greater and ordered the erection of a large building. This was done and there was no larger building in the lands of the Inca. It kind of sends shivers up your spine when you read something that was written, you know, in 1557. And you're standing here looking at it, still standing today. Miracoche was one of his main gods, an idol in pre-Inca, which they worshiped. It was called the Ascador, the savior. There seems to be a pattern emerging",

Rising 204 feet from the desert sands, this was a breakthrough in the history of construction. It didn't have smooth sloping sides, but instead rose in a series of levels or steps.

A line drawn exactly midway between these marks would point due north. Using just this low-tech method, the Great Pyramid was aligned with breathtaking accuracy.

All it is, is two pieces of wood joined together at 90 degrees at the top with a crossbar and a hanging plumb line. To calibrate it for use, it is placed on a flat surface of water and then a line which you can see there is marked right behind the hanging plumb line.

As the pyramid rose, this soft core sank under the weight. The architects had to come up with an answer, or the pyramid might collapse. Construction stopped.

And it's obvious that as you scrape the mark disappears and with it, of course, the high spot. This same technique was also used in the final stage of construction. The rough internal blocks were covered with an outer casing of perfectly smooth stone. This was carved from the highest grade limestone and had to be carried across the Nile to the pyramid's site.

What bugged me, what really got me was there was a third, smaller one, offset from the diagonal. This faulty diagonal reminded him of the stars of Orion's belt.

Just eight inches wide, they climb upwards through the solid stone interior from the kings and queens chambers toward the surface for over 200 feet.

While the other points to Al-Nitak, one of the stars in Orion's belt. This constellation was the heavenly equivalent of Osiris, the Egyptian god of death and resurrection",

The pyramid speaks through its architecture and through its symbolic astronomy. Although Boval's theory is totally rejected by some Egyptologists, other mysteries and rumors still surround the shafts.

Others head further into the port. To dock at numbered mooring rings. The Great Basin can hold over a hundred vessels. Surrounding them, another engineering marvel, and a hint of the majesty of Rome. Not only warehouses and harbor offices, but giant temples and statues too",

So what might have led to the collapse of the harbor? In the core samples, layers of sediment from after the construction of the harbor help build a picture of events. When we find these layers and when we see it's not like the deposits that are above or below it. So we can see that it's in fact an isolated incident. These layers suggest that something cataclysmic churned up the sediment. There is a reference that talks about a possible tsunami in the year 115 AD. Maybe that's the event, maybe not.

Many businesses were often run exclusively by highly skilled domestic helpers. You'd seldom find a Greek citizen who'd want to be an employee anyway. Employees could be laid off at any moment and they had to endure the indignity of taking orders from another citizen. The best job for those who want to be employed was offered by the state.

Over the next 40 years, the Spaniards drove the Indians from their cities and slaughtered them in their thousands. Bingham really is intrigued by the history of the last Incas and what they'd done after the Spaniards arrived. Bingham's eyes were drawn to an account where a young Inca emperor named Manco had led his people as they fled their capital city, Cusco, in 1536",

But the Spanish conquistadors were in hot pursuit and the Incas fled again. This time, the chronicles said, they went down from their mountain homes into the Amazon lowland. There, protected by a dense jungle in the largest rainforest in the world, they built a new city called Vilcabamba. And it was here that the Inca people were brought to the island of the Inca. And it was here that the Incas made their last stand. But it was all to no avail. In 1572, the Spaniards finally defeated the Incas. And so with their death, their last refuge, Vilcabamba, disappeared from history. The Inca people were left behind",

If Bingham had found the ruins of the former Inca city Vidcos, it meant that he had to be on the right track, and close to completing his objective, finding their last refuge, Vélcabamba. The chronicles said it was a long two-day journey from Vidcos. By now, Bingham's blood is up. I mean, he realized that these ruins are topping over like nine pins. You know, he's found Machu Picchu, he's found Vidcos, and there's one final place he wants to find, which is a place where the Inca emperor and the exiles escape to if the Spanish ever came looking for them",

It was a place that even the local Peruvians feared, like the Spanish conquistadors before them. One of our informants said the Inca city was called Espiritu Pampa, or the Plain of the Ghosts. To be reached only by a hard trail passable for barefooted savages, but scarcely available for us, unless we chose to go on our hands and knees. Finally, after several days traveling, Bingham found beneath the thick twines of a rainforest jungle, evidence of some ruins. To his excitement, the locals called it Espiritu Pampa. Even better, they also called it Vilcabamba. Surely Bingham had found the last refuge of the Incas",

Bingham wrote in his diary, The more Bingham dug, the more he became convinced that the site just wasn't special enough to be Vilcabamba. But if this wasn't the place where the Incas had their last refuge, then where was it? Slowly, Bingham started to reconsider the evidence. He went back to the Spanish Chronicles.

Would the Incas, who are Highland people, have really made a home down in the Flatland jungle? It does not seem reasonable that such people would have cared to live in the hot valley of Esperitu Pampa. These Inca ruins are unique in lying so low in the Amazon jungle.

It was constructed as a royal estate and served as a sacred and seasonal retreat for the Inca rulers whenever the weather was severe in their capital city, Cusco. Everyone now tends to the view that it was built as a winter palace for an Inca emperor, probably the greatest of them all, Pachacuti.

As the waters of the Mediterranean recede still further, they reveal wide stone terraces, spanning out from the mouth of the volcano, the size of 20-story buildings. They point to one cause. They're called pyroclastic flows, torrents of superheated gas and molten rock. The pyroclastic flow can cover everything. They travel like a hurricane. They can destroy everything on their path because of the high temperature, up to 1,000 Celsius. When they hit the sea, the pyroclastic flows cool and become solid ramparts of rock. In Santorini, they stretch for a staggering 20 miles in every direction",

But that of the Gadions was the turning point when Roman fleet managed to absolutely trance a Carthaginian fleet at sea. This was the defining battle where Rome went from a regional power to a superpower. The struggle between Rome and Carthage would last for another century. But victory here set Rome on a path to shaping the destiny of Europe for the next 700 years. As the last of its water runs away the Mediterranean reveals a final sea. What can draining the Bay of Naples teach us about the glory and the decadence of the Roman Empire? 2000 years ago Rome has grown far beyond its Italian homeland",

And why does so much of it lie abandoned beneath the waves? Now marine archaeologist John Henderson is exploring the secrets of this sunken city. Starting with the huge harbor walls that once surrounded the city's port. These are built by the Romans. They were incredible engineers.

It's one of the best ports on the western coast of Italy at the time. Wealth brought pleasure and excess to this Las Vegas of the Roman world. There were parties that was drinking. It was a place to get prostitutes. And writers at the time referred to it as a harbor of vice or a vortex of luxury. The famous Roman philosopher Seneca is appalled by what he finds.

Eupolinos came up with a solution that literally meant moving a mountain, a tunnel running straight through Mount Castro. It would be a huge project and a lengthy one.

Otherwise they would pass each other like ships in the night. Without sophisticated surveying equipment, it was a remarkable challenge for an engineer to take on.

In 478 BC, Athens, together with the city-states of the Aegean, formed a mutual defense alliance called the Deleon League, the ancient world's version of NATO. By 450 BC, Athens has become the undisputed leader of the Deleon League, which is nothing more than a money faucet for the city-state. But Pericles, as undisputed leader of Athens, finds ways to put this money to the best possible use by building massive public structures that best reflect the grandeur and magnificence of Athens. Now legend has it that Poseidon, God of the Sea, and Athena, God us of wisdom, each came to the Acropolis to compete for the patronage of the city, the outcome to be decided by the inhabitants",

It would take thousands of laborers and skilled craftsmen to create this magnificent temple, and it would cost more than any building the Greeks had ever engineered, 30 million drachmas, in our terms, billions of dollars. That's an amazing, an amazing amount, but keep in mind that was a huge state enterprise. Construction on the Gargantuan building project began in 447 BC. The Parthenon was to be about two-thirds the length of a football field. Its outer dimensions, 228 feet long, by 101 feet wide. The first challenge was to cleave the marble from a mountain quarry, 10 miles away. In all, about 30,000 tons of the fine white stone would be needed. In the quarry, workers used the natural cracks of the stone to separate giant marble slabs from the mountainside",

Because an enormous energy was given by hammering all these wedges simultaneously, so that the brittleness of the material makes further cracking. Once the giant slabs were ready, gangs of men used levers, ropes and pulleys to maneuver the marble and prepare the stone for transportation to the acropolis. But accidents often happened. There was a enormous risk that this big block would slide further on, killing people underneath. But cutting and transporting the marble from the side of the mountain was only half the battle in the construction of the Parthenon",

Carpenters then inserted wooden plugs into the notches, which served to align and center each drum with the one above it.

The method most often used was to tie the end of the rope to the top part of a metal S-hook, fasten shorter ropes to the bottom of the hook, and then loop these around small protruding knobs called bosses that had been left uncut from the marble for this very purpose.

It starts with the stairs, goes up to the columns, all the way up to the top of the building in the pediment, that triangular element at the top. So let's take a look at the stairs.

Such long lines, which are more or less at the level of your horizon, tend to curve. So in order to extinguish this effect, they curve them the other way.

He was a great explorer. No Andean mountain seems to have been too high for him, no jungle, too dense. Eventually they reached the Inca ruins on the flattened peak. For Bingham it was a magical experience. Choque Corau was built in the 15th century and was believed to be a sacred Inca dwelling and one of their frontier fortresses. It was designed to defend the approaches to their great capital city, Cusco. Bingham wrote to his wife, Alfreda, to tell her it was the most interesting place he had ever seen",

He opened the pages of the Spanish Chronicles, a key source on Spain's golden age of discovery, conquest and colonization of the Americas. He began reading more about the Incas and of course even as a non-academic, the story of the conquistadors and the Incas is incredibly exciting.

He hardly mentioned the Machu Picchu ruins when he returned to the campsite below. In fact, his best friend Harry Foote wrote in his diary no special things to note. Ingham discreetly asked Lizaraga about the Lizaraga 1902 graffiti. Lizaraga told Ingham, Augustine Lizaraga is the discoverer of Machu Picchu. He lives at San Miguel Bridge, just downstream of your campsite. At that point, Haran Bingham must have sighed and thought, well, that is that. He actually writes it in his diary",

Pitha too, both Malaya and Pitha Singapore, had been thought to be completely unassailable. That the British were totally in charge militarily. And he proved them wrong. He made the British capitulate",

With the gold now stuck in the Philippines, Yamashita was being asked to come up with another miracle. The story goes, he was told to hide the gold until it was safe to move it.

It said Yamashita ordered detailed maps to be made of the exact location of each treasure vault. And each map was carefully encoded. These maps were done in an old Japanese dialect called Kanji, a language which is between 1500 and 2000 years old. And there were no topographical references on them.

But a full six months on from finding the entrance to the tunnel, Roger still hadn't found any treasure. Roger had spent all the money that he had raised to start the dig to begin with, and no one was going to give him any more money. No money meant no crew. It seemed the hunt was over. Roger had squandered his life savings on a huge mistake. Just before Roger decided to give up once and for all, he had one last go with his metal detector. Then he heard its telltale buzz",

This find is the most significant find of anything that anybody had discovered in the Philippines. The Buddha was in the Burmese style. According to the legend, the Japanese had looted religious artifacts from temples that were in the temple of Buddha. He really must have found one of Yamashita's 175 treasure vaults.

When Charlie arrives in California at the beginning of 1848, it's still essentially a wilderness. There's barely a population of 20,000 in a vast expanse of territory. The city that's going to become San Francisco has fewer than a thousand residents. So really, it's a vast expanse with very few people in it. And the people who are there are mainly ranching cattle. It's nothing like what he envisioned. He was thinking it was going to be the land of milk and honey and prosperity, but it's barren. No one's there. There's no prosperity, and he's really disappointed",

There is a mania to get to California, and as far as everyone's concerned, every second counts. It's not just getting there, but it's getting there quickly.

Each time, the lake would eventually evaporate, returning the area to desert once more. But it's thought that at times, the lake wasn't just a lake, but a lake that was once a desert.

Just three weeks later on the 5th of November 1870, Charlie set out into the desert once more. He was certain he would find the ship. He even took a different route to avoid the quick sand that had foiled his first attempt. But it wasn't long before Charlie was in trouble again. It seems that Charlie is so preoccupied with the horrific experience with the quick sand that this time he's forgotten to bring the basics. First, his food supplies run out. If you're out on the desert and you run out of food, you're pretty well doomed. Even if you were lucky you could kill a rattlesnake and probably eat it",

You've got to find water now, not tomorrow, not the next day, now. You simply cannot survive these conditions without water and Charlie, the very first person to find water is a man. Even though he was still 30 miles away from the ship's reported location, Charlie didn't turn back for water. He was still in the water and he was still in the water.

Then Charlie spotted something on the desert floor that told him he was getting close. These shells convinced him this area was once linked to the sea. Now there was no way he was turning back.

He has enough supplies for a small army and he's determined to succeed at any cost.

In front of you, the Arch of Titus, an arch built to celebrate Emperor Titus and the victory that he obtained against the city of Jerusalem in the year 70 AD. Let's move around this big group and let's have a look at the internal decoration. It is in fact an historical memory of what happened at the end of that victory. Depicted inside is the so-called Triumph, a procession that the emperors could do when they won big wars. Depicted is the emperor on a chariot with the soldiers in front of him, and on the other side, the treasures carried by the soldiers during that triumph, including the menorah",

Look at the amazing columns to the right side. There were many other columns surrounding the building, made of grey granite, but unfortunately most of them are gone. This is because during the Middle Ages and during the Renaissance, materials of the buildings of the past used to be taken, reused and recycled for the construction of new monuments. Look at the Colosseum, a great view and a great spot for your pictures during your trip. From the terrace where we are now, during Easter the Pope has a very famous celebration.

You have to know that Emperor Hedgen was an architect too, in fact he designed his own villa in the city of Tivoli, that's what we call Hedgen's villa.

But that triumph could be obtained only if they had killed more than 5,000 enemies.

Going back to the main piazza we take the sacred road one more time and we're going to see now the other side of the Roman Forum. As we were saying, all these areas being completely changed during the Kingdom Age, but many other buildings were added during the Republican Age and then during the Imperial Age. When the Roman Empire fell, it was the year 476 AD according to the tradition, all these areas were abandoned. Look at the floor, imagine it paved with beautiful marble and look into the right you see again the sacred road that we're going to take. When you hear kiosks, money changes, imagine places where people could come. This was the central area of Rome",

It's a ramp created by emperor Domitian, remember the third emperor of the Flavian dynasty",

You can see that today on top of it we have just trees and gardens, but you have to major it full of palaces, the houses of the emperors. Those palaces were unfortunately destroyed during the Middle Ages and during the Renaissance, specifically by the Popes. They were reused for their materials. During the construction of St. Peter's Basilica, many of the materials were taken from those palaces. That's why today, on top of the Palatine Hill, we don't have much left. According to the tradition, the city of Rome started on the Palatine Hill. Ramelus, as we were saying, was the first king. He had a twin brother called Rimas",

Of course when pharaoh was relatively young and fit this would have been a great celebration but in the case of poor Pepe then in his nineties it became all too clear that pharaoh was no living god and this really undermined the whole concept of what it was to be a pharaoh. Clearly as mortal as his subjects any natural disaster must have seemed the fault of this less than superhuman king. And his combination of a weakening pharaoh and failing harvests led to rapid decline. Ancient Egypt now faced its first major political crisis. For the power and apparent divinity of the pharaoh that had been so very important in the pyramid age had now vanished",

In this time of growing uncertainty when the Egyptians had lost faith in both the monarchy and state run religion they increasingly turned to the power of magic. This is a rather unsettling thing. It's an ancient Egyptian mask. It's almost four thousand years old and it's made of linen covered in a thin layer of plaster and then painted predominantly black with colours picked out on various features. Of course the Egyptians are well known for making elaborate arrangements for their afterlife. The death mask placed over the mummified body recreated the features of the dead to make them recognizable to the gods. But this mask is different. It was made to be worn by the living",

One of the most graphic ways they did this was to take a piece of clay or a simple pot like this one and write upon it the thing or the person that they wanted to control.

This exact place wasn't drained up until the 1st century BC and was known as the Lacus Gurtius, the Lake Gurtius. The edge of the circular altar features a marble relief depicting this legendary Sabine warrior. Can you imagine? Originally everything here between two hills were only marshy lakes. A great sewage project was initiated, Cloaca Maxima. And then, in the beginning of the 7th century BC or little later, the Roman Forum came to life. Remains of the Basilica Emilia, 100 x 30 meters built in 179 BC. It got its name from the Emillian family. Besides shops, the Basilica housed the stalls for city bankers. It was also a meeting place of politicians, its tax collectors",

Most of the buildings in the Forum we see, build of brick and tufa, were once covered with marble slabs. This allowed Romans to imitate Athenian architecture at a lower cost. White marble, local and readily available for Athenians, was expensive in Rome, hence the common practice of covering buildings with thin slabs of marble, which now decorate mainly Roman churches",

As long as the flame stays lit, Rome will enjoy prosperity and peace. Its unique as for a Roman architecture, a round shape, was to symbolize either the primitive Roman huts or the earth crowned by the heavens.

Work went on for decades, brick by brick uncovering a vast metropolis of the Iron Age, and great amounts of information on the Assyrian era of the first millennium BC. Yet underneath that city lay far older foundations. In 1931 the latest in a long line of astonishing discoveries was made. For 1500 years before the Assyrians, the place had originally been built by Akkadian workmen. It was in the Akkadian layers of the city that a number of artefacts were discovered. Chief amongst them, a great bronze head, thought to be part of an impressive statue of an Akkadian king",

Allegedly using not daggers or poison but cylinder seals, strangling him in a back room. The texts that have been uncovered so far do not state who orchestrated the murder, though being such a brutal ruler, he had no shortage of enemies. The most likely scenario though is that the assassins acted under the orders of the elder brother, Manish Tushu, who promptly ascended the throne, inheriting the many wars his brother had started. Around 4,260 years ago, 964 men sat down to a feast in the land of Agade. Great pieces of mutton and pork roasted on spits, bread, olives, vegetables and of course vast quantities of beer flowed.

The story doesn't end there though, at least not in the popular Sumerian and Akkadian literature that would follow a century or two later, once some semblance of order was restored by the final Sumerian dynasty, that of Ur, which formed its own successor empire to the Akkadians. There are several legends about Sargon in particular, mostly revolving around his life and conquests, that were compiled into various mini-epics, and recited by poets and bards as they travelled from city to city. Telling stories of the great figures of the past. Interestingly, there are also several works of literature dealing with the life of Naram-Sin.

The Akkadian king implores the gods to give him a sign or an omen as to how he can win back their favour. But it's all in vain. After seven years of frustration, in anger, Naram-Sin sends his men to destroy the Echor, Enlil's holy sanctuary in the city of Nipol.

And yet, the events that may have ultimately brought about the city's downfall, namely Gutian attacks and widespread famine, do seem to have some basis in history.

In Roman history we have a tendency to focus on the aristocracy, the important people and the world changing events. But in Legion we illuminate the day-to-day experiences of the soldiers and those around them.

And perhaps these buckles have been opened to plunge in the final knife blow. This object reminds us of the hazards of being a Roman soldier. The risk of violence combined with disease and illness made life as a Roman soldier a very risky one. In AD 115, Trentianus himself faced a revolt of his own, the Jewish Diaspora revolt, which spreads to Alexandria. And he talks about putting down the anarchy and the uproar of the city. He himself was wounded. He sent me word about a woman. With my consent he was buying one for me",

Now, as a Roman soldier, if you've survived battle, how might your downtime look? Not every soldier would have faced the dangers of battle, but almost all soldiers would have known the day-to-day life of living in a Roman fort.

Now, Trentianus writes home asking for permission to buy a woman. This would be a concubine, and so he needs permission to bring a woman into his household.

Pyramid experts and enthusiasts tell us the Great Pyramid is made up of 2.3 million large blocks of stone, the vast majority being limestone, but some of them are granite, and that these blocks were all accurately cut and fitted together to build the incredible monument. This aligns so precisely to the cardinal directions. And although some of the granite blocks do weigh a lot more, it's often quoted that on average, the 2.3 million pyramid blocks each weigh around 3 tons. Armed with this information, you often see people make calculations like this one I found on the internet. Assume workers work 12 hours per day 7 days a week each year. 12 times 7 times 52 weeks each year equals 4368 working hours per year. 4368 hours times 20 years equals 87,360 total working hours",

Each block had to be cut out of the quarry, then it had to be carefully shaped by stow masons, dragged to the construction site, had to be set accurately next to adjacent blocks, and then the process had to be repeated 2.3 million times, with the work getting more and more difficult as the structure rose in height.

You just need a solid framework and then you can backfill the Mastarba with rubble, with the addition of mortar to bind it all together.

But as well as speeding up the first stage of the pyramid building process, the gathering of materials, using rubble would also save time when the material gets to the pyramid. You don't have to set the rubble in place with accuracy and precision. Once the rubble gets to its destination, you could place it into its designated space with the addition of mortar. It doesn't matter what the sides and shapes of the blocks are, just as long as the space is filled. Of course, whether you use cut blocks of stone or rubble, it won't speed up the transportation of the material",

Well, Naya Skarab shows the interior of the notch on the northeastern corner of the pyramid, famously entered into by Bob Brier and shown on the Khufu revealed documentary. When Brier entered this notch, it was extremely dark, but Naya Skarab adjusted the levels and brightness and we can now see that as we enter the pyramid's core, the blocks of limestone are rough and irregular. Yes, they are generally large and bouldersized, but they do have an irregular shape",

Instead they used A. cut blocks of limestone of varying sizes and B. a large amount of irregular blocks also of varying sizes, the material I'm calling the rubble.

In fact I would even question the idea that these are voids at all. When Giovanni Caviglia lifted the limestone slab at the foot of the niche in the queen's chamber, he found sand and rubble going down at least 3-4 feet. A void has also been detected to the north of the queen's chamber and west of the horizontal passageway, and when this was drilled a few decades ago, all that was found was sand",

That is remarkable. The entrance reveal a network of unknown hidden passageways that could help the team decipher when and why this amphitheater was built.

You can see this from the way that it's curved and also from the way that everything is sloping backwards. So underneath our feet here, there would have been steps going up that would have been the Roman seating for the stage, which was over on this site.

How was mankind created by Prometheus, and why were the horrors of the world unleashed from Pandora's box? What awaited the souls of the dead in the realm of Hades, and how were monsters such as the Hydra, the Cyclops and Medusa slain by famous heroes? From the 12 labours of Hercules to the Trojan War, this is the entire story of Greek mythology. Music In the beginning there was only chaos, a great void of emptiness, but from the chaos sprung Gaia Earth, as well as Eros love. They were then joined by night and day, who had put an end to the reign of Erebus, darkness, with the eternal cycle of dusk and dawn emerging",

Eros For one man in particular, Eros shot many arrows into the hearts of potential lovers, who found themselves attracted to a beautiful young man who went by the name of Narcissus. While he was blessed with great beauty, he was also burdened by vanity and arrogance, taking pleasure in cruelly rejecting the advances of many women who pursued him",

Dionysus would grant Midas his wish, with him returning to his palace in joy, touching everything the eye could see.

As Zeus sat on his throne on Mount Olympus, he looked down upon the world, with the beautiful Alcmini, the grandchild of Perseus catching his eye. Descending to earth, Zeus would lay with Alcmini, with her soon falling pregnant with a son named Heracles, later known as Hercules to the Romans, with Zeus planning to make his son the next great king of Greece. But little did he know that his wife Hera, the Queen of the Gods, had been watching these events unfold. In the past she had sat idle, while Zeus had fathered many illegitimate children, but this time she had finally had enough",

When Heracles was about to be born, she used her magic to delay the birth, while also speeding up the birth of another descendant of Perseus, a child called Eurythias. As Eurythias had been born just mere seconds before Heracles, he had become the next descendant of Perseus, with Zeus being forced to give him the kingship instead. While Zeus could do nothing about his son's lost kingdom, he did manage to get his own revenge on Hera. After Heracles was born, Zeus brought him up to Hera's bedchamber on Olympus",

Growing up, Heracles received an education from some of the most renowned masters of Greece, in all things from archery to music. One thing that became clear from a young age was that Heracles had a very short temper. This, combined with his supernatural strength, made him dangerous to both his friends and enemies alike.

After taking a look around, Heracles himself thought the task impossible to complete. He instead headed to the nearby rivers Alpheus and Peneus, which he hoped would do the job for him. Obeying the restrictions Eurythias had given him, Heracles used no tools, instead using his bare hands to dig a canal which flowed from the rivers down into the stables. Once completed, a great torrent of water came flooding into the stables, washing away years of filth in an instant. The water continued to flow into the surrounding farmland, fertilising the fields with an enormous amount of manure",

Growing up in the wild, Atalanta would learn to hunt, soon becoming a devoted follower of the goddess Artemis. By the time she became an adult, Atalanta was one of the greatest archers in the land, able to fight, run, and shoot better than almost any man. After hearing of the expedition, gathering to slay the Caledonian boar, Atalanta would be keen to join, wishing to win the glory and prove her worth as a hunter",

Heading south, they would sail around the shores of Greece before heading north towards Ithaca. But as they neared home, a great storm erupted, blowing them off course and towards a large island where they hoped they could find refuge from the seas. Stopping on the island, they would soon spot a shepherd's camp in the distance, with Odysseus handpicking a small group of warriors to accompany him. Taking several cases of wine to trade, the hungry crew were overjoyed when they saw large supplies of cheese and meat within a cave next to the shepherd's flock. The warriors would help themselves to the supplies, but soon the cave's owner would return",

Twenty years after leaving home, Odysseus would finally set foot on Ithaga, ready to see his wife and son once again. But Ithina, knowing that his homeland was not as he had left it, would warn Odysseus of the dangers that awaited in his palace. Transforming him into an old beggar, Ithina made sure that Odysseus would enter his home in disguise, for his wife Penelope, having been alone for twenty years, was expected to remarry, with suitors from far and wide coming to win her hand",

And on the subject of the night sky, as everyone learns from childhood, the names of almost every planet and moon in the solar system are derived from the gods, goddesses and other characters of this rich mythology. It was claimed that one of these deities, Apollo, would utter words of prophecy through the vessel of a high priestess known as Pythia who resided at the Shrine of Delphi. While there were other seers or oracles within the Greek world, the Oracle of Delphi became the most well respected and known throughout the ancient world owing to the apparent accuracy of her often cryptic responses",

Alexander had been planning yet more conquests first that of Arabia to the south and then to confront the upstart Romans far to the west for some they had had enough fighting for one lifetime. The empire was divided among four of his generals in what would become known as the successor kingdoms. For the next half century they fought each other over the spoils of land that Alexander had conquered. In the east much of the heart of the Persian empire was lost to the new Parthian empire although the Greek Bactrian kingdom in today's Afghanistan survived for another 200 years. Despite his short reign Alexander's legacy was enormous",

The New Testament of the Bible was first written in Greek for example.

Despite seeming invulnerable throughout the wars of Alexander in Persia, the phalanx proved to be no match to the well-armored, flexible and highly mobile Roman legions with Macedonia suffering a crushing defeat against Rome at the battle of Sinosophele in 197 BC",

Curranth itself was sacked and many thousands of Greeks taken back to Rome as slaves.

The Greek and Roman pantheon was very similar, hinting at a distant common ancestor of the two peoples.

During a war with the Venetians the Turks used the former temple as a magazine to store their gunpowder. A mortar round from the Venetians hit the magazine causing the entire mass to explode shattering much of the structure of the building into ruins. These indignities and deprivations could not continue indefinitely and unsurprisingly a resistance movement had begun as soon as the occupation started. But it wasn't until the early 19th century that real hope emerged. Sentiment within Europe particularly amongst the British, French and Americans was heavily pro-Greek as since the Asia Enlightenment knowledge and admiration of ancient Greece was strong",

And so with the help of these powers and wealthy Greek expats within Britain and the United States our prizings within the Greek peninsula were financed and carried out in 1821. The backlash from the Ottomans was severe with populations massacred but this only made the resolve of other countries more determined. Britain, France and Russia declared war defeating the Ottoman fleet at the Battle of Navarino in 1827. Greek rebel forces were then able to advance on land.

What made this era stand out? The ability to make tools and weapons from iron and steel. This Iron Age changed how people lived and shaped the future of civilizations. And books also told us that iron technology came to India way later. Often we are migration or trade from the Near East with the earliest widely accepted dates around 600 to 800 BCE.

The Athenian general Themistocles succeeded in luring the Persian navy into the narrow straits of Salamis. A large number of Persian ships became disorganized and were beaten by the allied fleet. Wary of being trapped, Xerxes withdrew much of his army to Asia. In the process he lost much of his forces to starvation and disease. Still focused on conquering Greece, Xerxes left his general Mardanius to complete the war. The following spring the allies assembled the largest hoplite army ever. They proceeded to march north from the Isthmith to confront Mardanius. Then the ensuing battle of Plataea. The Greek infantry again proved its superiority",

The Greeks would now move to the offensive, eventually expelling the Persians from Europe and the Aegean islands. The Greeks had defended their land against the oppressive forces twice.

After news of the death of the king, many revolts happened. The new king was quick to stop the revolts in person. On this tour around Greece, Alexander was recognized as the leader of the fragmented Greek world. A war with Persia was known for some time and the Greek world would trust Alexander and his father's veteran military to defeat it. In 334 BC, he led his army across the helispont into Asia Minor. His army was about 40,000 strong. His infantry was commanded by his general Parmenon. The bulk of his army lied in his 9,000 Macedonian phalangites",

The phalanx formation is great in front, but it is hard to maneuver and is susceptible to counterattack at its rear or sides. Because of this, Alexander had 15,000 more hoplites that could block the flanks and defend the rear. 7,000 lightly armored troops were used as skirmishers and as missile troops. Some of the most effective troops in his army were the 1,000 shock cavalry known as the companions. Alexander would personally lead these groups into battle on many occasions. Over 2,000 other cavalry were also used. When Alexander crossed the helispont, the Persian world quickly took notice",

He would burn all crops and take all the food out of the area. The Persian satrap did not want to see his province burned and instead decided to test his army. At the Battle of Granicus, Alexander's army met 10,000 Persian cavalry and 10,000 Greek mercenaries. The two armies were separated by a shallow river. Alexander led his elite cavalry across the river and met heavy resistance. He bought time for his phalangites to cross the river. Alexander was in the thick of the fighting.

Rome was surprised to hear of this and decided to make an example out of the foolish Greek. Rome was not messing around and sent a powerful army of Romans and Greek allies. Philip's army buckled under the immense pressure of the Roman and Greek army. Roman troops made it to Thessaly by 198 BC. In 197 BC the Romans decisively defeated Philip's last forces causing him to sue for peace. Rome sanctioned the power of the Greeks through treaties and attempted to destabilize the region. They then left leaving no military force behind. They still had little interest in the region and only wanted to vanquish an enemy",

When Rome pulled out of Greece at the end of the Second Macedonian War, they thought they had left behind a stable peace. However, by weakening the last remaining check on Seleucid power, they left behind the opposite. The remaining Macedonian nation and Philip himself now asked for Rome's help to defend Greece from the expansion of the Seleucid Empire. The situation made worse by the fact that Hannibal was now a chief military advisor to the Seleucid Emperor, and the two were believed to be planning an outright conquest not just of Greece but also Rome. This threatened the existence of Rome and the Republic began to plan a large offensive",

Over time, these settlements grew in complexity, giving rise to some of the world’s earliest cities and states.

The Sumerians developed one of the first systems of writing, known as cuneiform, which they used for record-keeping, literature, and legal documents.

The casing stones are joined line to line to within 10,000th of an inch and their joints are filled with some kind of mysterious cement that nobody's been able to figure out what the formula is",

Inside the Great Pyramid are a number of fascinating chambers and corridors like the Grand Gallery, this towering stairway that goes up into the so-called King's Chamber. Mainstream scholars theorize that the Great Pyramid was built as a tomb for the Faro Kufu, who reigned from 2589 to 2566 BC. But archaeologists have yet to find any human remains or authentic grave markers within the structure. The design of the tunnel system and chamber rooms within the Great Pyramid have convinced engineering expert Chris Dunn that the true purpose of the massive structure was to act as a power plant, distributing energy through obelisks",

We're taught in school that the Great Pyramid is a tomb, but if you look at the complexity of these buildings, the precision with which they were built, the features that you see on the inside, these various shafts and passageways, for me it looks like a machine. With more than 50 years of experience in the aerospace industry, Dunn believes that chemical reactions took place within the Great Pyramid that generated electromagnetic waves. You have two shafts leading into the Queen's Chamber, and these shafts delivered the chemicals to the chamber that they would make some boil of hydrogen, and then the hydrogen would pass through another passageway to the Grand Gallery and then into the King's Chambers",

You have evidence to support the theory that hydrogen was being fed down the northern shaft, which leads to the King's Chamber, and then it enters the chamber and collects the energy that has accumulated in that chamber and then directs it through the southern shaft for the microwaves to spread out. So that energy would reach large distances, and I think if you had an obelisk at any distance, it could actually affect that particular structure. The Great Pyramid is itself a power generator, and that energy is broadcast from the pyramid",

Kufu took what Sneferu did to the next level, but certainly without Sneferu's work, Kufu would not have been able to achieve such a stupendous monument. Everything about the Great Pyramid is exceptional. Even by modern standards, it's an engineering phenomenon. The precision of its planning began before a single stone was laid on site. Its base is a near-perfect square, each side measuring 756 feet, covering an area the size of seven Manhattan blocks. It's as tall as a modern 44-story building and it weighs some six million tons",

From an engineering point of view, when you come to a place like this, you look down because the clues of how they built the pyramid are written in stone on a scale of acres here. Although it is 4,500 years old, it was built with astonishing accuracy. At the base of the monument, engineer Glenn Dash finds evidence that the foundations were meticulously prepared before construction began. We're now standing on the bedrock and originally the bedrock sloped at a six-degree angle from the northwest to the southeast. They carved all of that way",

But that still wasn't good enough to build the perfect pyramid. They would lay out on the bedrock a platform. The platform itself is one of the miracle of the pyramid. Despite its unassuming appearance, this stone platform is one of the pyramid's most impressive and critical engineering marvels. It's perfectly leveled over its entire periphery, almost a kilometer, to within plus or minus one inch. That was one of the keys, the perfectly flat, perfect platform to build the perfect pyramid.

You simply take a stick and you stick it in the ground. The stick doesn't have to be straight, it doesn't have to be vertical. You just have to do the test on either the spring or the fall equinox. The equinoxes are the two days each year that fall midway between mid-summer and mid-winter. And ancient Egyptian sky watchers would have noticed that on those days the sun rose and set directly east-west, casting a near-perfect west-east shadow line as it passed. Glenn argues that by marking the tip of that shadow as it moved, with stones for example, the architects could lay out an accurate east-to-west line",

But why put so much effort into aligning the pyramid so accurately? Like every aspect of its design, the orientation of the pyramid had symbolic significance. It mirrored the pharaoh's own supernatural alignment with the sun god Ra. The afterlife of the pharaoh was modeled on the afterlife of the sun. So it was the similarity between the life cycle and resurrection of the sun and the life cycle and resurrection of the king that leads us to believe the pyramid was primarily a solar monument.

Constructed more than 4,500 years ago, this is the step pyramid tomb of Pharaoh Joseph, a king of Egypt's third dynasty. It's a revolutionary masterpiece designed by Egypt's pioneer architect, Imhotep. His achievement was massive, not just for the Egyptians but for humankind. Born as a commoner, Imhotep rose to become Pharaoh Joseph's trusted advisor and eventually his chief architect. He invented the stepped pyramid using stone blocks instead of mud bricks, allowing him to build ever bigger. More than 2,000 years after Imhotep's death, he was worshipped as a god all the way up to Greek and Roman times.

It's 24 days into the dig and they've caught a glimpse of an opening at the bottom of the shaft. Big discovery within this vault. We are going down now to see the entrance, close to the fingers. This is the moment Miraslav has been waiting for. Be excited when it's rising right now. He could be on the brink of an historic discovery. So here we are. Oh, there's a wonderful limestone circus. Untouched for more than 4,000 years. But up close, Miraslav discovers evidence of destruction. That's sad, that's very sad",

It was torn apart in antiquity because the most important target for the tomb robbers was his birthstone jewelry.

Ptawer had led an expedition to the lands east of Egypt and brought back precious stones, ivory and minerals. Materials he used to revolutionise pyramid decoration. Commanding hundreds of skilled craftsmen, he continued Imhotep's legacy and built in honour of his king. In return for his groundbreaking work, he was buried near Imhotep's great pyramid at Sakara, the most sacred burial ground in Egypt. It's something extraordinary for Ptawer to be depicted in such scenes like this that he's only just sitting, eating and relaxing. We are now sure that Ptawer was really a high official and that's why the king was able to reward him for what he has done",

Nice, let's go Frederico. Let's go, let's go. We are down using those stairs. Yes. So are the roads here the same as they used to be during the ancient times?

And then also the houses of the people, homeless people that colonized those buildings. It's typically Rome. Many buildings, ancient Roman buildings suffer this kind of exploitation. I told you that the Christian Catholic Church became a owner of this place. So a congregation as well of own part of the Colosseum. And the Colosseum became very famous for those processions that held the good Friday Easter time. That's why at some point they even thought to build a church in the Colosseum. It's too bad it's not here today. We have more than 900 churches in Rome. It's a pretty unique site, right? In an arena to have a cathedral",

You don't want to build your own church, but to us, to those guys. But those are quite recent kind of images. Because they were all painted by this community of Danish people. Which lived in Rome in the beginning of the 19th century. The waltz and many, many of those under, many of those Danish people.

There you can see a forum, a temple of Venus house, they give you the the terrace of the earth and obviously it's very difficult to imagine how this was back in time so that's why I have a... Yeah, I've seen some pictures, it's really hard to imagine. I mean, maybe. So it doesn't look like that. It's hidden there. Right. It's too bad. It's totally gone",

Abandoned by the Inca and with the jungle slowly reclaiming the site over a couple of centuries, Machu Picchu was eventually rediscovered and brought back to the world's attention in the early 1900s",

Now the Inca undoubtedly lived here at some point, but were they really responsible for everything that we can see on this remarkable site? A close examination of both the site's architecture and of the story of its past suggests that its megalithic roots may well stretch back much further in time than orthodox archaeologists believe.

In this video we're going to take a closer look at some of the features of Machu Picchu and then dive into the history of this site and the story of how it was rediscovered by the adventurers and archaeologists of the early 20th century. Located on top of some very steep mountains in southern Peru, Machu Picchu looks down on some spectacular valleys and the roaring Urembamba River. It sits at a height of around 7,970 feet or 2,430 metres in altitude. This actually makes it one of the lower elevation sites when it comes to the Sacred Valley region and it's a misconception that I often hear that Machu Picchu is at some very high elevation. The reality is Machu Picchu is considerably lower in elevation than most of the other well-known ancient sites in Peru",

He was looking for Vilcabamba. He focused on that place. So where is Vilcabamba? Taking from here train. And after this bus, take at least eight hours to get Vilcabamba. And Vilcabamba, by the way, it was the last refuge of the Incas, where after the war between Incas and Spanish start, most of the Incas just run away until this place.

And after this, carried the vegetation. He has to make their paths. Why? Because the original Inca trial, you can see the narrow lines up there, which one it was, the big connection to get Cusco. Now, as there is a nice Inca trial, make for four days roughly. But that will start from my hometown.

A link to that video is in the description box below. As a brief summary, these three styles begin with something called Hanan Pacha, which is the oldest style. It's categorized by the monolithic nature of the work. It's the shapes and carvings that are made into the living rock of the mountainside itself. This is generally found on the bottom layers of architecture, and it visually appears to be the oldest form of work",

This is the cellular polygonal masonry generally made up of very large and very precisely fitted stones, like those at Saqsay Hwaman or in the streets of Cusco, or as you'll see here at Machu Picchu. This work is usually of a uniform stone type, and that stone type has quite often been transported significant distances to the site.

The majority of the buildings at Machu Picchu are Ukenpacha. I think the majority of the work here was done by the Inka, but not the megalithic core. And interestingly enough, I think most of these Ukenpacha buildings were covered over with mud mortar. In today's times, there's not much of this mud mortar remaining, but as you can see from this photo, Harem Bingham found that some of these walls still had their mud mortar coverings",

About noon, we reached a little grass hut, where a good-natured Indian family, who had been living here for three or four years, gave us welcome and set before us gourds full of cool, delicious water, and a few cold-boiled sweet potatoes. Apart from another hut in the vicinity, and a few stone-faced terraces, there seemed to be little in the way of ruins, and I began to think that my time had been wasted. However, the view was magnificent, the water was delicious, and the shade of the hut most agreeable. So we rested a while, and then went on to the top of the ridge",

The superior character of the stonework, the presence of these splendid edifices, and of what appeared to be an unusually large number of finely constructed stone dwellings, led me to believe that Machu Picchu might prove to be the largest and most important ruin discovered in South America since the days of the Spanish conquest.

He and his crew had to quite literally cut their way through the jungle and carve steps and switchbacks into the steep slopes such that their human porters could transport their supplies up to the site.

Although it is too early to speak definitely in regard to the civilization of Machu Picchu, a short description of the principal characteristics of the city may not be out of place. Machu Picchu is essentially a city of refuge. It is perched on a mountaintop in the most inaccessible corner of the most inaccessible section of the Urembamba River. So far as I know, there is no part of the Andes that has been better defended by nature. A stupendous canyon, where the principal rock is granite and where the precipices are frequently over a thousand feet sheer, presents difficulties of attack and facilities for defense second to none",

These dates and the short time frame of the Inca is important to remember when you look at all of these sites in Peru.

I think that most of it was destroyed in some form of cataclysm perhaps even the younger drys but there are certainly other contenders that happened on other dates. I think that the Inca rebuilt what they could, they repaired what they could and they reused the megalithic stone in their own constructions when they couldn't find the original locations for these stones. Often you'll see megalithic stones used as lintels in doorways or inserted just here and there into those rough stone walls that the Inca clearly made. Here's author and researcher Brian Forrester explaining how this process might have worked",

Because their, you know, the Inca's role was to build buildings out of what was available so they recycled some of the damaged structures from the early megalithic builders. What's intriguing about the Inca is that they appear to have been incredibly respectful of whoever it was that first built Cusco. They seemingly would never touch any of the surfaces and remove something but if something was on the ground it's like well we don't know where that goes so let's use it to build something around it or to enhance what's already been here. Oyente, Tambo, Machu Picchu, Saxe, Waman being very classic examples of that",

They had to have stone that either had a high quartz crystal content or iron content. So the basalt which is what this is possibly comes from one quarry 50 kilometers in that direction and then there's the limestone which sucks a waman which is right here and its quarry is about 10 to 15 kilometers in that direction and there are other quarries too of great distance and the important thing for the megalithic builders was any structure could only be constructed out of stone from one quarry",

To me the architecture of Machu Picchu seems to tell a similar story to that of many other of the ancient ruins in the Peruvian Andes. I think it's certainly possible if not even likely that parts of this site are vastly older than the Inca civilization. A civilization whom undoubtedly lived here and worked on the site and left indications of their presence via the remains of ceramics and ritual burial",

This interpretation seems consistent with what the Inca themselves said about their own origins with talk of a megalithic civilization existing thousands of years ago one that was mostly destroyed and whose descendants many centuries later eventually arose and spread to become the Inca. It's consistent with much of the new data coming from adjacent scientific fields like paleo climatology geology and genetics. I think that given all of the supporting evidence circumstantial though much of it may be this interpretation of the origins of Machu Picchu is worthy of much more mainstream discussion. All right well I hope you enjoyed that look into the origins of Machu Picchu. If you did please remember to give the video a thumbs up and subscribe to the channel if you haven't done that already",

There will be a part two to this video that's coming very soon it is actually mostly all edited and put together. I moved it into another video lest this one be like an hour and a half long but there's I want to take a detailed look at some of the areas in Machu Picchu. There's a lot of really interesting architecture and some details there that we didn't cover in this video. There's some alignment stuff related to the hitching post of the sun and a few other things so that that video is going to come out I promise within the next few days",
