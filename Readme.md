# Immersive Historical Storyteller Chatbot

This project implements an AI-powered chatbot that provides immersive stories and answers questions about ancient civilizations based on a curated dataset of YouTube video transcripts. It leverages OpenAI embeddings for context retrieval and a large language model (LLM) for generating engaging narratives. The chatbot is presented via a user-friendly Gradio interface.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Immersive Storytelling:** Generates detailed and engaging stories about historical topics.  
- **Contextual Q&A:** Answers specific questions based on retrieved information from video transcripts.  
- **Semantic Search:** Uses OpenAI embeddings and Pinecone vector database for efficient and relevant context retrieval.  
- **Conversational Memory:** Maintains a simple in-memory history to provide more coherent follow-up responses.  
- **Gradio Interface:** Provides an interactive web interface for easy interaction with the chatbot.  
- **Modular Design:** Separates concerns into different scripts for data preprocessing, embedding, and the main application.

## üìÅ File Structure

- **Preprocessing.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook for cleaning and chunking raw video transcripts, saving to `pinecone_data.json`.  
- **pinecone_data.json:** JSON file containing preprocessed text chunks with metadata (video title, topic). Generated by `Preprocessing.ipynb`.  
- **pinecone_embedding_uploader.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook to generate OpenAI embeddings for text chunks and upload them to a Pinecone index.  
- **context_format.py:** Python helper functions for retrieving and formatting context from Pinecone, imported by the main app.  
- **gradio_app.py:** Main Python script running the Gradio interface and handling user interaction via the `ImmersiveStoryAgent`.  
- **RAGagent.ipynb:** Notebook likely containing core RAG logic, prompt definitions, and interaction flow for development/testing.  
- **.env:** (Not included) File to store your OpenAI and Pinecone API keys securely.

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <project_directory>
Set up Virtual Environment
python -m venv venv
# Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Or install manually:
pip install python-dotenv openai pinecone-client langchain langchain-openai langchain-community gradio
Configure API Keys
Create a .env file in the root directory and add your keys:
OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
PINECONE_API_KEY="your_pinecone_api_key_here"
Prepare Transcripts (Optional)
If you have new video transcripts to add:
Open Preprocessing.ipynb and run all cells to preprocess and chunk transcripts into pinecone_data.json.
Upload Embeddings to Pinecone
Run pinecone_embedding_uploader.ipynb to generate embeddings and upload them to your Pinecone index.

## Usage

Run the Gradio chatbot interface:

python gradio_app.py
Open the local URL shown in your terminal (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:7860) to interact with the chatbot.

üìö Supported Topics

The chatbot supports these ancient civilizations and historical topics:

Great Pyramids (Egypt)
Roman Forum (Ancient Rome)
Ancient Greece
Machu Picchu (Inca Empire)
Mesopotamia
Sangam Tamil Civilization
Example queries to get started:

"Tell me an immersive story about the Great Pyramids."
"Where is the Roman Forum located?"
"What was daily life like in Ancient Greece?"
"Tell me about Machu Picchu."
"Who was Sargon of Akkad?"
"What is the significance of the Sangam Age?"
The chatbot provides immersive stories or specific answers based on context and may suggest follow-up questions to continue your journey.

Enjoy your immersive journey through ancient history!
