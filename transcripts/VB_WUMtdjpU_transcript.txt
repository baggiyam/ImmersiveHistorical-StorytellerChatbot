 Machu Picchu. Once a vast ceremonial city perched high up in the Andes. Built in the mid-15th century, it was the crowning glory of a vast Inca empire. But its origins, they're shrouded in mystery. The genies that led to the creation of this iconic city were the first to come to the world. The genies that led to the creation of this iconic city started somewhere. Where there is an end, there is also a beginning, and I intend to find it. My name is Albert Lin, and I look at the world in a unique way. I use 21st century technologies to look back into the past. Check that out, I can actually fly through the secret ancient world. Lasers that scan deserts, strip away dense jungle canopy, and scour the oceans to uncover the hidden worlds beneath. We're wading into uncharted waters. That's what a real lost city looks like. New discoveries in the most awe-inspiring places on Earth. That's where pixels become reality. That fill the gaps of our story. Who we are, where we came from, and the wonders we can achieve. Here we are in the 13th century. Wow, this is carved out of the earth, huh? This is the new golden age of exploration. We know the secrets. Machu Picchu. It's up there with a stonehenge, with the pyramids and quiza. It's an incredible feat of engineering, of design, of imagination. This royal city sits high above the sacred valley of Peru, South America. The Inca believed that these mountains were dots. What we see here is the architecture of power. The signature of the Inca is vertical terracing, wide-open plazas, grand temples, and ceremonial doorways. Yeah, it's called a double-jam gateway. More classic Inca. At first you kind of take it for granted, but when you look a little bit more in detail, you realize that the carving and the masonry is just unbelievable. This is a separate rock from this rock, and yet they fit perfectly together. You couldn't fit even a razor blade between these two stones. And this was shaped with stone tools. This speaks to the monumental effort and genius of the Inca world. It's a masterpiece. What I'm trying to get to in this journey is how much peaches came to be. It wasn't a spark from nothing. Were those mighty Inca warriors, standing on the shoulders of giants, of earlier civilizations? Armed with 21st century technology, I'm headed deep into the Andes to find out. Hunting for the origins of Machu Picchu presents an immediate challenge. It's unclear what evidence I should be looking for. Before the Inca, Peru was inhabited by smaller competing tribes. Maybe finding evidence of these people will point me in the right direction. Look at those mountains. Yeah, really, really beautiful, huh? Archaeologist Tom Hardy studies pre-Inca remains, close to the town of Raya Yachta, 60 miles southeast of Machu Picchu. This is a Quechua village? Yeah, some of the older generation only speaks Quechua. It was the language of the Inca Empire, really. So when we hear people speaking, we hear the words of the Inca? Yeah, pretty much. Hello. Local legend tells of an ancient site hidden on the hillside. But for those who choose to explore it, there's also a warning. When you go to Machu Picchu, you'll find a lot of people. When you go to the hillside, you'll find a lot of people. It's a big city. But when you go to Machu Picchu, you'll find a lot of people. That's why it's called the Manu Picchu. Mindful of respecting local traditions and beliefs, we still head towards the hillside. Do you see these rocks and this little wall here? Yeah. This might be Priyanka. Priyanka? Yeah. So people have been using this road for thousands of years? Yeah. Should we go up? Let's do it. We're immediately confronted by thick vegetation, with no obvious route up the hill. Maybe kind of a dead end here. Yeah, I'm stuck here too. Damn it. You all right? Yeah, that one really got me. Yeah, maybe this isn't the right way to go. What's that? Oh, there's a whole skull. Oh yeah? Oh wow, you're right. Wow. Looks like a leg bone there too. Look at that. It looks like this person has been buried in a small cave in the rock face. Well, this probably would have been based here around 600 to 1000 years ago. That means that this grave has been sitting here looking across this view since before the Inca, since before even Manchu Picchu existed. Mm-hmm. Wow. Do you think there's more up there? Yeah, probably. The grave proves that the Pre-Inca visited this hill. But did they live up here? It's tough to imagine. These spikes are like razor blades. It's a good thing I have an impenetrable metal leg. I have a thorn right in my crutch. I can't move. Oh, look at that one. Oh shi- That one, that was right where you don't want it to be. Oh. Okay, maybe that's not where we should go. We're not even a quarter of the way up. Not inside. It's just so hard to get around and this is near vertical. And there's just thorns and cacti everywhere. They're tearing me up right now. Villa Gelder, Faustina, talked of homes of ancient people. But so far, all we've discovered are small walls and a rock tomb. And we're struggling to get any further up the hillside. Time for my technology to cut through the cactus. This is Howard T'jo and Duncan, do you copy? Where? There we go. And there we go, live feeds out. Look at that. So what we're going to do right now is scan up along the whole top of the mountain and look for specific structures. You get a better sense of what we're looking for. That's a good idea. And also any older path that might allow us to access the top of the site. We're looking for any trace of pre-Inca buildings. Oh, now, look at that. Now that looks like a structure to me for sure. Yeah, it looks like maybe two or three of these little structures in a row on the ridge line. Yeah, right there, right? Yeah. It looks like a little neighborhood on the side of a mountain. It's amazing. Maybe what we should do is map out the sections where we're seeing the most anomalies and then fly the lidar in a sectioned grid. Yeah. It looks like the main target areas are right over on this edge of the ridge line. We should be able to get a good set of material there. Hopefully from that, the lidar data is going to lead all these thorns digitally. It's going to reveal stuff that you really can't see just beneath the surface of all that growth. Some specific anomalies that we can go and try to ground truth. Cool. I am genuinely excited to see what's on that hill. We've discovered bones in a cave near Raya Yachta, but thick vegetation and razor sharp cacti prevent us from exploring the hillside further. So we're using lidar to strip away the vegetation digitally. What I'm really trying to find is evidence of things that came before the Inca. How does a place like Machu Picchu appear? We've built the site with everything we have, so I think we've got plenty to show you. From the basics, what was collected. So here we have the 3D model with the vegetation. Now let's turn it off and then we'll see what's underneath. Moment of truth. Look at that. Wow, it looks like a whole city up there, isn't it? Oh, wow. It really reveals so much. Look, there's more all over the top of this mountain. There's these little features. These terraces, it almost looks like a bunch of little buildings. Yeah, some of them are probably terraces with buildings on top of them. There's definitely some bigger structures there. So what I think we should do is we're obviously going to have to ground truth all of this if we can get there, but maybe follow these semi trails on the way up and then try to bush whack into some of these other sites over here. Yeah, it's like this. Yeah. That might be a way up. We return to the hillside and the intense undergrowth to look for actual evidence of anything pre-Inca. It's a good thing we had machetes this time. Yeah, hope they helped. So pretty thick. So we're right here. We're going to make our way up the ridge, over to the top, see if we can find any of these anomalies. But this part's going to be a little sticky. So careful here. Some of these rocks move a little bit. Whoa, whoa. You all right? I'm all right. I just fell into a hole. Let's go see if we can find these features over here. Yeah, we got a lot of stuff in front of us. Yeah. I thought the jungles were bad. It's way worse. What are those? Chulpas. These would have been houses for the dead. Oh, yeah, look at that. So these are tunes. Yeah. Check that out. It's a really well-preserved one. Oh, look at this. Anything in there? No, most of them are going to be empty at this point. This one's almost definitely pre-Inca. This is a pre-Inca. How do you know? These Chulpas, they start in a pre-Inca period, around 1,000 AD. They build these circular ones in small little spaces. So this is actually almost like a village for the dead. Legend claims an ancient site is hidden on the hillside. Here's our first evidence of pre-Inca buildings. Were there have been mummies in here? Yeah, probably. Mummified ancestors, oftentimes they were built with platforms in front. People could come, they could bring the bodies out. That's why they're open doors, right? So they can access them. They would commune with the ancestors, they'd feed them and drink with them. Death was not the end for people in the Andes. But it looks like there's these rectangular, much larger structures just that way. Yeah. See if we can find those. Okay, cool. Can you see right there? Oh, look at that. A couple of structures here. So we got that square Chulpa there. And then we got this little guy, and then we got the much bigger one over there. Yeah, right? Those are the things you pointed out. So that Chulpa, I think, is pre-Inca. These square structures and rectangular structures, I think, are Inca. Really? Yeah. The Inca are building right next to the dead of those who came before. Yeah. Oh, wow. All right, let's keep going. Okay. Man. Wow, look at that. There's all those Chulpas right there, all along the ridge. Yeah. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. They might even continue more. This whole mountain is just chocked full of them. We got two of the dead. Those ones up on the top of the ridge are all Inca. They're all square Chulpas. Why would they build right next to the old Chulpas that came from a time before, but not destroy them? Well, destroying them isn't the point. They're trying to appropriate them. They're making a political statement with this sort of religious practice. I'm sorry to understand. The Inca came. They saw this place. They saw people leaving their mark here, and they said, we're going to leave our mark here as well, but bigger and higher. Yeah, pretty much. They're saying, now our ancestors are here, and they're above yours. We still respect yours, but ours are more important. The Inca were essentially saying, we are here, and this is ours now. The Inca seem to have brought the ancestors of other tribes into their culture. These tombs were here before the Inca, but they didn't destroy them. Maybe they incorporated them into their belief system. We found the dead. Now, where were the living? The living? The living? The search for the origins of Machu Picchu is complex. We do know that religion was at the heart of Inca life. So I'm investigating the roots of their belief system in pursuit of another clue. I'm using a document from the Spanish Chronicles describing the cult of the Huiticocha. It's a creator god that dates actually even back before the time of the Inca. It's one of the earliest documents that we have describing what was happening here. Huiticocha came to a province called Cacha, and the indigenous community showed up armed, ready to fight. And when he saw that, he punished them. Huiticocha instantly caused fire to fall from heaven. My understanding of a lot of origin stories is that maybe they could have come from observations of events, geological events, natural events, like for example, a meteor falling from a sky. So now I just need to look for something that might inspire a story of fire falling from the heavens. Okay, so check this out. This is the Earth from above, from space. It's satellite imagery. And this is Machu Picchu. Right here. So let's look around the region. What is that? Well, that looks like a volcano to me. Look at that. You see the crater? And it looks like there's stuff built all around it. Are these ancient? So there's a village somewhere around here that's maybe part of this story. Perhaps the key to unlocking the origins of Machu Picchu rests in a belief system. Hidden amongst the lava flow. Kin Sachata volcano last erupted only a few thousand years ago. This is pumice. Volcanic rocks. And this is the place where the volcano was built. Volcanic rocks. I head for the summit with Peruvian archaeologist Amelia Perez Trujillo. We follow the flow of lava. We're meeting my lidar team at the top. I'm looking for evidence that this was a sacred site for people who were here before the incantation. You guys ready to fly? Just about, yeah. Okay. Flops up? These are all chupas. Right here. Just over that edge there. Look at that. These are the three chupas that access the volcano. These suggest that people were burying their ancestors close to a god-like event. They made their offerings. It's a place of importance within their ideology. It's a 30. You can imagine that when it erupted it must have sent wonder. Just disbelief into the minds of the people all around it. All the material went that way. Towards the city. Exactly. Up to the bottom. Incredible. The lava stretches for over a mile. At its base is a small town called Rackchi. These must be the man-made structures that I could see on the satellite imagery. In certain times here, they were in these spaces. This whole area, all of these were homes of people that existed hundreds of years before the Inca. Yes. And they built their homes next to a volcano. Amazing. But pre-Inca pilgrims weren't the only ones to have left their mark here. Wow. It's incredible. It's impressive, isn't it? This is an Inca construction, but it's built on a ritual space of pre-Inca. It's the largest and highest construction in the Inca era. Amazing. What was it for? It's the temple of Diracoche. The temple of Miracoche. I have a document that I found from the Spanish Chronicles. See? It says, when the Inca ruler passed by this area, he saw the shrine of Diracoche. The people told him the miracle of fire that fell from the sky. He decided that the remembrance should be greater and ordered the erection of a large building. This was done and there was no larger building in the lands of the Inca. It kind of sends shivers up your spine when you read something that was written, you know, in 1557. And you're standing here looking at it, still standing today. Miracoche was one of his main gods, an idol in pre-Inca, which they worshiped. It was called the Ascador, the savior. There seems to be a pattern emerging. The Inca incorporate aspects of earlier belief systems and make them theirs by building bigger and better. This is architecture of power, just like at Machu Picchu. It seems like we are piecing together a detective story and it's all adding up. Neither the pre-Inca city of the dead, nor the city of worship, look like Machu Picchu. I'm headed to an Inca site that's both an older and higher altitude than Machu Picchu. Perhaps there, I'll find a city of living. Oh, it's my cavalo. Hello. We're headed to that peak. At 13,000 feet of elevation, it's going to be a trek. I've got a lot of gear. The Inca buildings at Watta are around 100 years older and at an altitude 5,000 feet higher than Machu Picchu. Tom Hardy and Peruvian archaeologist Aranjokarse are joining me. There's horse poop everywhere. Low-tech transport empowers high-tech gear to help us reveal why the Inca built and ruled here. Watta is more than twice the height of Mount Rushmore. The air is thin and the going is tough. We're at 11,600 feet of elevation. We got a ways to go. This steep drop right off here. There's a pretty promising way to go if there are any diver About a thousand feet from the top, imposing Inca walls loom into view. The structure feels familiar. Look at this face. How could they build in such an intense environment? You have to be born with super lungs. Well, like Adam, when you're born here and you're raised here, it's easier to move around, right? I think it was easier for me. The hardest part for him was waiting for us. Oh, wow. What it means in the local language, an island. An island? Yes. An island in the sky. Really is a pretty impressive view from up here, isn't it? Huh. Look at this. These look just like the double jammed doors they saw at Machu Picchu. Yeah, these are Inca symbols. They demarcate very special, important places. Very specific people would have been allowed to come through here. So the whole top of the mountains encircled by a wall with these double jammed doors, that means that it's maybe spiritual. They're definitely restricting access to this place. Amazing. It's a promising start to our expedition. Inca came, put this wall up here. They transformed the site, made it into an Inca place. So this was all here before the Inca even showed up. Part of it. A lot of this is Inca construction on top of the earlier settlement. We know from Machu Picchu and the city of the dead at Raya Yachta that the Inca built high to assert their authority. And this place is high, more than one and a half times higher than Machu Picchu. Look at this. This is the top. Look at this view. This is pretty impressive. Why would they build something like this? This high up in the mountains? Well, we have some ideas based on the relationship with the landscape. I think people living here thought that they came from the mountains and the mountains was their ancestors. The mountains being the ancestors, the actual mountain being a being that humans were born from, is that correct? Like a person, it was their father, their ancestor, their grandfather. They become these objects of sacred veneration and respect. Not only to the Inca, but to the people even before the Inca then. Probably. Yeah. We're standing here on a mountain top, just like Machu Picchu was on a mountain top. Yet, unlike Machu Picchu, there might be evidence of activity here before the Inca. So what if we take our technology and try to scan the entire mountain top, really make every little piece of evidence of that existence pop back out to life? I think we should try. Let's do it. As the sun sets across Watha, it's easy to see why these mountains were once considered considered so sacred. It's about six in the morning. The sun just crested over the ridge there. It's providing us a lot of warmth that we need. Cold front hit us last night. It was brutal. Dropped about minus seven degrees. Look, everything's frozen. We've got hot water bottles warming up the batteries because they're just too cold to work right now. But there was no moon, so the stars last night, unreal. We've got a long day in front of us, so we're going to get a crack on it. The mountain has been surveyed before, but this will be the first time it's ever been scanned using LIDAR. We hope to uncover new finds, both Inka and our pre-Inka. How does this look for a base to set up? It's a carious. Yeah, let's just be really careful about the edge here. It's certainly good for LIDAR. I mean, look at the view off there. You're looking straight down onto rock outcrops and mace bits and masonry already. Look at those edges. It just falls off. Isn't there nothing else, huh? It's going to have to be so careful with the flight. We have never used our drone-based LIDAR at an altitude of 13,000 feet before. And you have thin air up here, too, right? So it's trickier flying? Super tricky. I mean, we've got the high altitude props on there, which help, but still, if you lose a drone, it's a sheer drop. Hopefully, with this survey, we can delete all of that grass and see what's really there, what's hidden beneath that veil. It's up. Our drone survives the extreme altitude and data processing gets underway. As darkness falls on water, the results are in. So this is all of the aerial LIDAR combined. This is with the vegetation on. So this is the point cloud as captured, basically. Yeah. Then let's delete it. Ready? Wow, look at that. Yeah. Wow, it's impressive. Incredible. It looks like the whole range has been carved. That's really cool. The LIDAR reveals signature Inca terracing. This area here, you think is mostly augmented by the Inca, is that right? Yeah. So in the most simple terms, what are we looking for, feature-wise, that might be from before the Inca? The most basic signature that we would be looking for would be the foundations of circular structures. And these could appear quite obviously, but they also could be a little more sort of destroyed or moved around by vegetation growing through the stones. Do you think we can actually use the machine learning and computer vision algorithm to look for circular features? Yeah, definitely. We can highlight the features based on a few different elements. How long will that take? That should be able to spin something up for you now. I knew you would. Look at that. There we go. What is that? That could be one of them. Yeah, it looks like it's on a bit of a terrace. Does that look to you like something pre-Inca? Yeah, I think so. I didn't see any of this today. I couldn't have seen any of these features from walking the ground. So if you can spot out any details that might look possibly pre-Inca, then we should go there tomorrow. We'll just geotag them and we'll go there with the GPS and find all of them. I think it helps us a lot to archaeologists to find where the structures are. Great work. Good job, guys. The first ever LiDAR survey of Wata has revealed intriguing features and they need ground truthing. But it should be right somewhere over here on this edge. I think I can see some stones there. It's hard to tell. Yeah, right there. You see the rocks? Yeah, right up ahead. It's gotta be it. We're searching for the circular structures revealed by the LiDAR. There's bits of pottery everywhere. Look at this. It seems to be a snake. It's not an Inca thing. Probably what about 1100 to 1300 AD somewhere in between there. Pre-Inca pottery. That's a good sign. Incredible. It's just lying here right in the dirt. Well, that's why ceramics are so useful for us. The plastics of the ancient world, they last forever. Well, that one fits. That one fits. There you go. Yeah, I'm guessing that would have been maybe the neck of a really big vessel. But it's hard to say. A pre-Inca snake looking back at us. Maybe a thousand years after it was used. Unbelievable. Okay, let's keep going. The LiDAR results seem to be taking us in the right direction. Is it circular? Yes. Wow, look at this. It could be pre-Inca, but we need to look. Well, what we're trying to find is anything that tells us what happened here. What would it have been for? It's like a well or something or a storage? It could be storage. I don't know. You're like the ceramics whisperer. You find stuff everywhere. Do you think you find it? Okay, we'll look for some. Looks like there's bits of ceramic all right back down there. Oh, here we go. Looking at the fabric and looking how eroded and soft it is. I would guess it must be pre-Inca because the Inca stuff is really well fired. It's really hard. It endures very well. Well, let's see if we can find more. There's more points on the data. Yeah, let's do it. We zero in on a large terrorist area. Oh, this looks like one of the circular pits. This is probably an opening, so this could have been an entry point here and it would have been built up above it. Look at that right there. What's that? Is that a piece of pottery? It's of cooking pot. It's like the burnt up, banged up metal pot you find in your mom's house. Yeah. So, food was cooked here. You know, it was smell it. When do you think it came from? I think it could be before the Inca. This is pre-Inca? This is pre-Inca, yeah. I think it was a house for a family. Really? So, could this be the residential area for this entire site? This certainly suggests that might be the case for the pre-Inca period. Just on the other side of what looks like a plaza are some square buildings that appear to have been built later. So, this is Inca? Yes, definitely. You could literally set up shop anywhere. Why would they build this here right on top of the prior? Before the Inca, it was a public place, public space. The Inca came and interact with pre-Inca. Well, the Inca would have been hosting people here, bringing in people to make them feel part of the community with food and drink. Suggesting this area was an important place for those sorts of events going all the way back to the very beginnings of this site. So, the Inca came here. They saw people living here and somehow they decided this is where they needed to establish their own world. I imagine that people would be sitting around this plaza and maybe a group of people were dancing in the middle. This would have helped create these community bonds, but also bonds of hierarchy and reciprocity. Then in return, we will help you build your empire and operate as people are part of the Inca state. It's as if the Inca, they came, they saw people living here and they incorporated their beliefs, but in a much larger scale and they completely modified the top of this mountain. So, when they were building Machu Picchu, they would have known about this place. Yeah, a lot of the things we see here, the way that the mountain side is completely terraced, all of that is very similar to what we see at Machu Picchu. It's not like they were practicing here, but by the time they got to Machu Picchu, they worked out how to do it well. Wow, well now the sun is setting. What do they call the sun? Inti. Thank you, Inti, for an incredible day. There's a belief system that I've learned that threads through time here. I believe that people come from the mountains, people come from nature. Through time, that belief has evolved into the architecture that you see today, here at Wada. It's an island in the sky. For the first time, Lidar data reveals the complete picture of the monumental scale of Wata and the efforts of human hands that carved this mountain. Once a pre-Inca ancient mountain top town, imagine this transformed by the Inca. Imposing residential areas, ceremonial plazas and grand terracing. This is the city of the living I have been searching for. There's been layer upon layer of experimentation, a prototype for what you'd see later. Because just over the mountain, on the other side of that white cap, is actually an infusion of ideas and beliefs through generations and through civilizations. Machu Picchu.
