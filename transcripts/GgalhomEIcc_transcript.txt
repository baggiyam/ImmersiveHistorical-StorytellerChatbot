 For centuries, we have read in our history books that the Stone Age began about 2.6 million years ago and lasted until about 3300 BC when the Bronze Age began and then came the Iron Age around 1200 BCE in the Middle East and Southern Eastern Europe. What made this era stand out? The ability to make tools and weapons from iron and steel. This Iron Age changed how people lived and shaped the future of civilizations. And books also told us that iron technology came to India way later. Often we are migration or trade from the Near East with the earliest widely accepted dates around 600 to 800 BCE. So the story seemed simple. Stone Age, Bronze Age and then the Iron Age. But does this narrative still hold true? Well, no. Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin recently declared that the Iron Age in Tamil Nadu began around 3,345 BC based on findings by the state's Archaeology department. This discovery reveals that iron arrived in India almost 5300 years ago, pushing the timeline back by 2 millennia. It means the Tamil Nadu Iron Age was contemporary with the Indus Valley civilizations, copper and bronze age. But this isn't just based on recent discoveries. Sangam literature, which dates back to centuries before, also mentions Tamil Nadu's long-standing connection with iron, steel and its thriving iron industry. According to ancient Tamil texts, iron, especially steel, wasn't just a local asset, it was a global commodity. Tamil Nadu's steel was in such demand that it was exported to places like Roman, Egypt and other parts of the West. Even Roman literature, Historia Naturalis, a monumental work of the natural history written by the Roman author Pliny the Elder in the 1st century AD, mentions that Tamil steel being taxed at Alexandria sports, showing how highly valued it was. Even the Sangam texts like Puranannuru and Kurunthokari also tells us that ancient Tamils were skilled in working with three types of iron. Irumbu, wrought iron, Urukku, steel and Ekam, a high quality weapon made from steel. These texts highlighted blacksmiths and their forges important to the iron's melting process, especially during wartime in Tamil society. Blacksmiths shaped not just the economy, but the social structure itself. Take Patiruppat too, a classic Tamil poetic work and one of the eight anthologies in Sangam literature. It mentions Kodomanal as a major trade centre for iron products. And now archaeological excavations there have even found ancient melting furnaces. What's intriguing is that regions like Central Anatolia, which is now called a modern-day Turkey, was often considered the origin of iron age. It relied on meteoric iron. Whereas the people in Tamil Nadu mastered the sophisticated technology of smelting, which is an advanced and challenging process requiring high temperatures, 5300 years back only. The sparks flying from the furnace while making iron, the steady fire blown through the nozzle and the action of the pedal bellows operated by foot is mentioned in Ahannanuru, verse of 72, 224 and 202. It depicts the powerful hammering of the red-hot iron on the anvil, where the item being crafted at struck. Over recent years, the excavations at Ujjain has even revealed remnants of blacksmith forges, including bellows, nozzles, anvils and iron tools, paralleling the descriptions in early Tamil literature.
