 With its mighty pharaohs, multiple gods, and magnificent art, it's easy to think that ancient Egypt was always powerful and successful. But there were also darker times, conflict, civil war, famine, and an overall feeling of catastrophe. And the only way it could survive was through its own resilience and the strongest of leadership. Now this is Sosostris III, who ruled Egypt almost 4,000 years ago. He's strong and he's muscular, everything a pharaoh should be, and yet look at his face. His scowling features have been interpreted to suggest his harsh rule and his large ears, his ability to hear any plots against him. Sosostris embodies the way Egypt's monarchs ruled during its turbulent times. This king controlled his enemies through a series of military fortresses and through magical curses. But this is a new era in Egypt's history, not only ruled by military power, but by fear and suspicion. And Egypt's darkest times threatened to destroy its entire civilization. I've already explored how Egypt's ancient culture began thousands of years earlier, blessed by the River Nile and a rich natural environment, and a society united by a complex ideology. But in this episode, we'll see how the massive self-confidence of the pyramid age was not to last. As a dark age, brought this civilization to the brink of annihilation. Make no mistake, this is the home of the dead and we're in amongst them. These were times of famine, civil war and anarchy. Kings have been reduced to something on a miniscule level. But this collapse triggered one of the greatest revivals of ancient times. With Egypt reemerging more powerful and wealthy than ever before. Welcome to my story of ancient Egypt. Sakara, where Egypt's great pyramid age began. But among its glories, there's also evidence of a far less well-known side to Egypt's story. Its descent into a dark age. The zenith of Egypt's old kingdom was the great pyramid at Giza, and only 200 years later, King Unas Causeway was created. It might not look much today, but it's the highlight of Unas Pyramid Complex. A 750-metre-long causeway which symbolically connected life and death. It goes right from the Nile Valley all the way up onto the high desert plateau, right to the foot of the Pyramid of Unas. So it would have been used for his funeral procession, but it would also have drawn up that life-giving force from the valley below up to the city of the dead here at Sakara. A narrow slit in the roof once allowed enough lighting. But the extraordinary thing is that this causeway was designed for a sole purpose. The King's funeral procession. Carved upon its walls are scenes revealing both sides of life, the forces of order and of chaos. It first portrays an idealised version of Egypt, a time of plenty. Here we can see typical scenes within an Egyptian temple or funerary context, scenes of the rich bounty of Egypt, all the fruit, the vegetables, the crops, the meat, the fish. All the wealth of the natural environment of Egypt, which was all obviously brought to the land through the good officers of the King, the bringer of all bounty, the intermediary with the gods. But also this causeway contained something rather more disturbing, evidence that dark forces were at work. Here on down the causeway emerged a counterpart image, the flip side of bounty. An image so unusual, it's now displayed in Sakara's museum and it really is one of ancient Egypt's most haunting and revealing works of art. Here we see these dark forces at work. What we have are two rows of emaciated victims of famine. These poor people, their wheat with hunger, they're falling down, they're suffering. And this is basically ancient Egypt coming face to face with reality because these are believed to be the Bedouins who inhabited the desert fringes of Egypt. So it's as if this kind of idea of suffering, the forces of chaos are on the periphery of Egypt but they're getting ever closer to the Nile Valley. Egypt is starting to waken up to the fact that chaos isn't all that far away. This is ancient Egypt beginning to suffer. Such gritty realism had rarely been portrayed before. Chaos depicted as the suffering of real people. This isn't happening in some esoteric realm of the gods where chaos is portrayed as some sort of disparate magical force very detached from reality. This is reality. Through such realistic images the Egyptians were expressing their fears to the gods, appealing to them to keep these forces of chaos at bay. But instead the starving famine victims would turn out to be a chilling omen. Up until now Egypt's prosperity had flowed from its one source of water, the River Nile whose annual floods enriched the soil, allowing life and agriculture to flourish. This natural abundance was the very bedrock on which Egypt and its perpetual world order was able to thrive. But this lifeblood was about to run dry. Evidence shows that at the end of the third millennium BC the Nile flood levels fell dramatically. As the very thing that brought them life began to diminish, the Egyptians believed that their gods had begun to abandon them. And for the next century the ancient texts talk of suffering, starvation and even cannibalism. Traditionally, Egyptian society had been built on the belief in the divine power of its kings. Without this belief the pyramid age would never have been possible. But now in its time of need Egypt's king seemed increasingly powerless in the face of such natural disaster. And this would come to a head with a ruler who was well past his prime. Plain to have lived for a hundred years, he was Egypt's longest lived monarch. King Pepe II. And this space was once a ceremonial running track, the type of place where Pepe would have to display his physical prowess to prove himself to his people. Now when any pharaoh had celebrated thirty years reign they had to perform the jubilee ceremonies and this involved running the ceremonial jubilee race. Four times around this circuit as king of the north, four times around the circuit as king of the south. It was the ultimate public display of their fitness to rule and their strength. It really showed who was in charge of Egypt. But that's where Pepe's advancing age would eventually let him down. Of course when pharaoh was relatively young and fit this would have been a great celebration but in the case of poor Pepe then in his nineties it became all too clear that pharaoh was no living god and this really undermined the whole concept of what it was to be a pharaoh. Clearly as mortal as his subjects any natural disaster must have seemed the fault of this less than superhuman king. And his combination of a weakening pharaoh and failing harvests led to rapid decline. Ancient Egypt now faced its first major political crisis. For the power and apparent divinity of the pharaoh that had been so very important in the pyramid age had now vanished. The fact is that the Greek civilization had begun to fall away and Egypt was plunged into a dark age. In this time of growing uncertainty when the Egyptians had lost faith in both the monarchy and state run religion they increasingly turned to the power of magic. This is a rather unsettling thing. It's an ancient Egyptian mask. It's almost four thousand years old and it's made of linen covered in a thin layer of plaster and then painted predominantly black with colours picked out on various features. Of course the Egyptians are well known for making elaborate arrangements for their afterlife. The death mask placed over the mummified body recreated the features of the dead to make them recognizable to the gods. But this mask is different. It was made to be worn by the living. And we know this because of the very distinctive eye holes which you can see there and this would allow the wearer to see around them. You can imagine when this was applied to the face fastened on tied on behind the head it would transform that individual into a completely different entity. Traces of paint on the linen reveal how it might have helped the wearer embody some form of magical being. Whoever wore this was going to some effort to transform their appearance. To try and tap into the hidden forces of the gods and to control the world in which they lived. It's as if the Egyptian individual that wore this was trying to take charge of their own destiny. But the mask isn't the only evidence of magic. For in their dark ages the Egyptians increasingly began to write out curses and spells on pots and figurines. Scrolled across one was the curse. Die henoui son of Inteth. A form of magic sufficiently small scale to be performed within their own homes. One of the most graphic ways they did this was to take a piece of clay or a simple pot like this one and write upon it the thing or the person that they wanted to control. They often used red ochre because red was associated with the powers of destruction. So if I was doing this I'd put on it the thing I'd want to stop which are early morning coals and alarm clocks. They've got to imagine Egyptians from all walks of life doing this. The priest wanting to protect the pharaoh, the soldier in battle against an enemy or simply a hated love rival. So all sorts of Egyptians could be on the receiving end of something like this. And then to activate the curse they smashed the pot. It was a symbolic act to annihilate the name of the enemy and therefore to control that enemy. That does feel better. Not unlike voodoo such practices are found in many ancient cultures and Egypt was no exception. But it's far from the way we imagine the formal time-honoured rituals of the temple led by the king at the head of the religious hierarchy. This is an Egypt that's becoming more suspicious, more fearful and more aware of the threats to their world, natural disasters, political breakdown and foreign powers. And this little wax figurine is a means to control anyone that threatens the balanced order of Egyptian life. The time when every element of Egypt's world view was in doubt. Their faith in their king, in their land and even in their gods had all faltered. This is one of the lowest points in Egypt's long story and its effect reverberated throughout the Nile Valley. The king, traditionally based in the north, was no longer the source of wealth, so royal officials abandoned court and relocated back to their hometowns throughout the country. Disunited, Egypt reverted back to how it had been a thousand years earlier, breaking up into a series of local regions called gnomes. And now a new kind of leader emerges to dominate the Dark Ages. No longer a single king, but multiple warlords. And we know much about one of them because he left his detailed autobiography in his rock-cut tomb at Moala, well away from the usual tourist sites. His name was Ank Tiffy. Now Ank Tiffy is a small-time official who's worked his way up through the ranks to become the regional governor, or no markers it's known. And in the decline in central government, the power vacuum that opens up is now filled by the Ank Tiffy's of this world. Ank Tiffy's tomb is quite modest by ancient Egyptian standards, but its interior walls tell of his rise to power. And Egyptologist Gary Shaw is going to help me unravel Ank Tiffy's story. You can see the man himself. Ah, the great man. The great man carved standing there. He's got a great hairstyle. He does. That is lovely. I'm liking him already. Yeah. I mean, Sophie has a great tomb as well. The hieroglyphs and images that fill the walls reveal how Ank Tiffy exploited the power vacuum at the end of the pyramid age, reducing the king to nothing more than a footnote. The only time you see the name of a king in the entire tomb is right here. This tiny little cartouche. Oh, it couldn't be any smaller. Look at the size of that. It's a nifikare, and that's it. Is that it in the old tomb? One mention of a king. I think that really emphasizes just how important he thought he was alone. He didn't need to mention the pharaoh. He didn't need to say that the king told me to do this, so I did this because of the king's favours. He just did it himself. That is extraordinary. I think that cartouche alone of everything in the tomb encapsulates this whole period. Kings have been reduced to something on a miniscule level, and the local rulers are shown on a huge scale, and it's all about them, isn't it? Anktiffy had enhanced his own political career and wanted to ensure the gods were in no doubt as to his importance. So the elaborate language, once exclusive to the king, was now part of Anktiffy's own boastful propaganda. This warlord was an ego maniac. He also says that he's a hero without equal, without peer, and you get that here. I'm a hero without peer. And pretty much almost every inscription in this tomb ends or includes this statement at some point inside. And what did he do to justify these claims? He emphasizes all the good things he did for the people. This was meant to be a time of drought and famine, so we're told in the texts, and he tried to guide them through this. He was managing it by feeding everybody and doing all sorts of good things, giving bread, the hungry, ointment to those without ointment, sandals for those who were barefoot, and wives for those without wives. So it's basically telling us about a time of turmoil. Yeah, but he's probably just over exaggerating because the more he exaggerates just how awful it is, the more great he looks when he says, well, these are the nice things I did for everybody. Yeah. And he talks about the entire south dying from hunger. Oh, look at that. That's a really graphic hieroglyph. I love that. The guy fallen over, yeah. Oh. Dead body. He's definitely dead. Yes. But then it gets even worse though. He says that every single man is eating his children. He didn't allow this to happen in his gnome, of course, where he lived everything was fine, and at the same time, he's also a fantastic warrior, we're told, over here. Evidently. I don't know if that was coming. Yeah, absolutely. I think the text on this particular column talk about his abilities as a warrior. In his biggest boast of all, Ank Tiffy, the local hero, almost claims the status of a god. I am the beginning and the end of mankind, since nobody like myself existed before, nor will he exist. In Egypt's dark age, warlords like Ank Tiffy had replaced the real kings of Egypt. And Ank Tiffy's delusions of grandeur, so vividly expressed inside his tomb, are even more emphasized on the outside because he chose burial inside a rock shape like a natural pyramid. He wanted to be the local pharaoh. And in a way, he was, because whoever fed and protected the people also led the people. And as the power of warlords like Ank Tiffy grew, so did the conflicts between them. And over time, as they either defeated their neighbors or formed alliances with them, two separate dynasties of warlord kings emerged. One in the north at Heracliopolis, where they wore the red crown of lower Egypt, and one in the south at Thebes, symbolized by the white crown of Upper Egypt. Egypt was a divided kingdom of two lands, and between them lay a war zone. Situated at its center lay Egypt's most sacred site, its earliest royal burial ground. And still today, an evocative and atmospheric place. This was the resting place of Egypt's first kings, whose mummified bodies were buried in elaborate burial chambers beneath the desert floor. A safe place for their souls, or so they thought. But hostilities between the two warring factions were about to plumb new depths of horror. With an assault so blasphemous, it would change the face of Egypt forever. One of the most violent acts was recorded in later texts as the vile deed. For the northern warlord kings fighting their southern opponents here actually desecrated these royal tombs. For their troops set fire to the tombs and destroyed the royal mummies. At a stroke, Egypt's physical link to its ancient past was severed. Such an act of desecration was completely unimaginable, and the Egyptian people were rightly appalled. Although the northern kings deeply regretted what their troops had done, the destruction was irreversible, and the origins of Egypt's royal past lost forever. Of course the problem with such times of destruction is that there's very little left of them for us Egyptologists to find. But clues do remain if you know what you're looking for. Today what's left of the violation of this royal burial ground is surprising. They've often seen thousands upon thousands of broken pots. Although most are not part of the destruction itself, they represent centuries of atonement for the loss of Egypt's physical connection with its past. Now not long after the desecration, this became a place of pilgrimage, where people came with filled with food, drink, incense, which they offered up to the souls of the dead kings once buried here. It was believed that death, these souls of the kings, had joined with the soul of Assyris, God of the dead. And as this place became a site of pilgrimage, it's as if the people of Egypt were trying to make amends for the desecration of the past. Egypt's spiritual connection to its royal ancestors was all it had left after the northern warlords had destroyed their physical remains. And the desecration soon provoked violent retaliation. Directly across the desert from Abidos, Leith Ebes, the stronghold of the southern warlords, and they would soon rise up against their northern rivals, an attempt to resurrect Egypt as a united land. Back in 2000 BC, Thebes was a one-donky town, and yet its warlords had two distinct advantages over other leaders. They lived on a bend in the Nile called a Kenna Bend, a strategic control of the northern warlords. And their local god was Montu, the god of war. The warlords of Thebes would reunite Egypt, and one in particular came to the fore. His images were carved into the walls of his Theban tomb complex, and his name tells as much. And the warlords of the Nile were very much. This is the Theban warlord, Montuhotep. And there's a real clue as to what was happening at this part of Egyptian history, because his name, Montuhotep, means the local war god Montu, is content, because hotep simply means content and happy. So if the war god was happy with Montuhotep, this means that he was a very powerful military figure. It is a wonderful scene. There are a lot of little clues here to tell us what's going on. And if you look really closely, you can see hands embracing him, flanking him, at his back, at his front, around his middle. He's been embraced by the gods, chief amongst whom is Montu himself. And there he is, his nose to nose with the king. He's giving him the breath of life and infusing him with his own divine power. It was the power of victory, one that finally brought an end to Egypt's first dark age. Montuhotep really did live up to his name as a true son of the war god, because he took his armies north, he conquered the north, and he reunited Egypt. But best of all, he's got the red crown on. And this is the red crown of the north, because Montuhotep is declaring to the world, I might be a Southerner, I might be from Thebes, I should be wearing the white crown. But look at me now, I have the red crown, I am the king of the north, I'm the king of the south, and I have reunited Egypt. As Egypt's new king, he became Montuhotep the second. But his victory came at a high price. The grim details of what his soldiers went through can be found on Thebes' west bank at Dere El-Bakri. It was inside one of the tombs here that the remains of Montuhotep's warriors were uncovered in 1923. Their bodies silent witnesses to Egypt's civil war of 4,000 years ago, which careful analysis revealed in fascinating detail. Now, the archaeologists found around 60 bodies in the tomb, and these are the original excavation photographs. All of them had been naturally preserved, naturally mummified in the hot, dry climate, so you've still got the skin and the hair. And crucially, evidence of how these men had fought and died. Some of these bodies had been pierced by arrows. This one goes right into the left side of the chest. Others had actually been buried with these leather rags. Ten of the warriors had been killed with ebony-tipped arrows. But in others, the wounds are even more brutal. You can see here, somebody's hit this man on the head with a real whack, and you can see this very, very graphic area of damage there. And after these series, a furious blow has been rained down on these poor guys. They lay helpless on the ground, and they're not even able to move. They've been rained down on these poor guys. They lay helpless on the field of battle. Their bodies picked up by vultures. You can see here, the dreadful damage. It's such a profound image. The bodies reveal evidence of the weapons used against them as they fought for control of Egypt. Arrows, slingshot, and even rocks had been hurled at the warriors from above. Naturally, their bodies were collected from the battlefield and carefully wrapped in linen. This linen bore the insignia of the Theban tomb complex, belonging to their leader, Montahotep. But just as significant as the bodies themselves was where Montahotep chose to bury his fallen heroes. Today, the warriors' resting place is a little known sealed tomb. But 4,000 years ago, Montahotep honoured his dead soldiers with a burial amongst the graves of his highest officials, making them part of his monument to victory. The new king had created what could well be the world's first known war cemetery. Now, I'm lucky enough to have been given special permission to see Montahotep's soldiers for the first time. These guys are going to be taken to the battlefield and taken down the tomb wall for me, allowing me to actually meet the very people who fought in Egypt's civil war around 2000 BC, so I am very, very excited. And it was the same curiosity which drove a team of American archaeologists to excavate their original mass grave in the first place. MUSIC Now reburied in a neighbouring tomb, the bodies of Montahotep's soldiers have rarely seen the light of day since their discovery over 90 years ago. MUSIC Is everything OK? Yes, everything is OK. Thank you very much. Thank you. Now, this is really, really super frustrating, but in the interests of health and safety, I can't go in there immediately much as I really want to, because all the stale airs built up as the walls being sealed, and we've really got to let this out with all the fungal spores and the bacteria and everything else that's so detrimental to health. Early Egyptologists tended to rush straight in and risk the so-called pharaoh's curse, so a little waiting is essential. I can't believe we're actually going into this tomb now. It's one of those rare moments. You get an Egyptological career into a tomb that's hardly ever visited. The wall had to come down, and who knows what we're going to find inside, because I certainly have never seen this before, so it's a very, very special moment. This literally wasn't a toll I expected. Nobody knew what to expect. It's staggering. I've never, ever been into a tomb quite like this before. The masques are a very good idea, because there's all sorts of things floating around in the atmosphere in here, not just the dust of ages, but the dust of human beings. And that's such we have to be very, very respectful. It's a large, rock-cut tomb, and although its walls are unfinished, it's typical of those created for courtiers and officials throughout these cliffs. Wow. It's a mummy-fied body. It's absolutely incredible. Oh, that's quite something. And if you look along the length of this very long tomb, look at the floor. This isn't stone. These are human remains and mummy wrappings. And there are chambers and corridors leading off, again full of wrappings, the linen of ages. Some of it is claimed to be the very linen that bound the bodies of Monthehotep's warriors to help preserve them for eternity. But at first glance, it's hard to get a clear picture. For this particular tomb seems to have been reused many times during Egypt's long history. Part of a shoulder. You see the way the skin's folded and dried out. Partial human body, still with much of it, soft tissue intact. It hits you immediately in the face and you come from said, with what a tomb is all about. Make no mistake, this is the home of the dead and we're in amongst them. It's a very, very emotive and powerful place to be. But what's striking is how little is left of their bodies. Like many other tombs up and down the Nile, they've been subjected to centuries of looting and damage. And amongst all these linen wrappings and debris and human remains themselves are the tangible remains of these men who died so bravely in their efforts to reunify Egypt from Monthehotep, their leader. I haven't just come out of that tomb. Very, very mixed emotions. I don't really know what I was expecting to see. Certainly some of Monthehotep's soldiers. Perhaps some of them were, it's highly likely. Essentially what we're looking at are the ancient Egyptians themselves. These are the ancient Egyptians. Temples, tombs, pyramids. This wonderful culture. It's all well and good studying these esoteric aspects that are distinct and marvellous and grand. But when it comes down to it, things we should really be interested in are these people. Monthehotep's reunification of Egypt marked a new beginning. The dawn of what would become known as the Middle Kingdom. And the rise of Thebes. Monthehotep made it the new spiritual heart of Egypt. And it would stay that way for the next 2,000 years. But whereas the war god Montu had dominated the previous century of Egypt's story, the deity that now took centre stage was Hathor, the goddess of love, joy, beauty and motherhood. The goddess whose origins can be traced right back to the earliest of times. And believing that Hathor dwelt in the cliffs of Dere al-Bakri, Monthehotep chose this site not only for his war cemetery, but for his own tomb complex. It was Monthehotep that first built here, in this dramatic place where the cliffs meet the desert. Believed to be the home of the goddess Hathor herself, it was a fast track to the afterlife. And for Monthehotep and his men, who'd lived and died by the war god Montu, they all now rest in the eternal embrace of Hathor. MUSIC The first to build at Dere al-Bakri was Monthehotep, the founder of a reunified Egypt. He was so influential that almost 600 years later, female pharaoh Hath Shepsut built her own funerary temple right next door to tap into the religious and political power of her illustrious predecessor. In the Middle Kingdom, life for ordinary people was on the up. Food was plentiful. Wealth and trade flourished. And farming was revitalised with new irrigation systems. Yet the Dark Age had nonetheless left its mark on the Egyptian mindset, as revealed in the way they prepared for the afterlife. In the Old Kingdom, tomb walls were often covered in elaborate scenes and texts, replicating an idealised version of the Egyptian world. But in the Dark Ages, people had seen their sacred sites ripped apart. So instead of such tumult, many in the Middle Kingdom opted for its cheaper equivalent, with something much smaller and much more intimate. While these may look like children's toys, they were in fact made nearly 4,000 years ago to be placed inside Egyptian burials. Now these wooden models were designed to provide the deceased with an eternal supply of food and drink in the next world. And so we have all the basics here, the Egyptian staples of bread, beer and beef. So we have the bakers at this end and they're grinding the grain to make flour, which will then be made into the breadloaves that are cooked in this fire. And the baker is in front there. The arms are quite damaged, but presumably shielding his face from the heat, as we know from other examples. Move to the middle and we have the butcher here, and he's cutting the throat. And the legs are bound here to keep the animal in situ while the deed is done. And then we move on to the end and we have the brewer. This is a fabulous, fabulous example, because he's pushing the mash through a sieve, and the sieves even being drawn on there, on the top. Actually in proportion with the rest of it, this individual's ordered rather much more than the other. Because this section of the model is almost half its length. But you can see the vats of beer carefully laid on their side. It's a wonderfully evocative piece. These people have been working for 4,000 years, and they're still at it. Look at them. The key elements of Egyptian culture were bak, and they looked little different from times of plenty in the past. And they were very different from times of plenty in the past. They were very big and they looked little different from times of plenty in the previous millennium. Look at this busy crew grappling with the sail, poles ready to launch the boat off the Niles banks. And this granary silo. Inside workers' hall sacks of barley, while a scribe counts the crop. And of course, there are also female figures. In Egypt, women enjoyed much the same status as men, unlike their sisters in many other parts of the ancient world. They're also producing one of the Egyptian staples, but linen, the cloth, which was used to make pretty much every Egyptian garment. When you see this standing woman here, she's spinning the thread with this spindle. And the thread that she's busy making, she'll then hand on to her two companions here, the weavers. And they're using this horizontal loom that's pegged to the ground to produce the bolts of cloth which will be fashioned into the wraparound dresses, the kilts, the loincloths, as worn by pretty much every ancient Egyptian man, woman and child. The lives depicted in these busy little...
