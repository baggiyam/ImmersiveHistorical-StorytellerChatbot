?!" Welcome to the Roman Forum, the political, religious and economic center of the ancient city of Rome. Let's discover together this amazing archaeological site. In front of you, the Arch of Titus, an arch built to celebrate Emperor Titus and the victory that he obtained against the city of Jerusalem in the year 70 AD. Let's move around this big group and let's have a look at the internal decoration. It is in fact an historical memory of what happened at the end of that victory. Depicted inside is the so-called Triumph, a procession that the emperors could do when they won big wars. Depicted is the emperor on a chariot with the soldiers in front of him, and on the other side, the treasures carried by the soldiers during that triumph, including the menorah. Moving to the right, in front of you, that is the Basilica of Santa Francesca Romana. We will see it from the inside later. Just keep in mind the amazing bell tower dated to the 12th century. Let's take this little road to the right side. You will bring us to a beautiful view over the Colosseum. Moving ahead to the left, you see a building with the European flags. Well that building is the museum of the Roman Forum, installed inside another archaeological area that we are just about to see. This area was created by Emperor Hadrian, you probably heard about him. He is the one that created the Hadrian Wall dividing Scotland from England. Hadrian is the one that restored the Pantheon in the city centre of Rome, and is the one that created what we call today, St. Angel Castle. So we are about to see the Temple of Venus and Rome. This temple, built by Hadrian, was considered one of the biggest of Rome. Look at the amazing columns to the right side. There were many other columns surrounding the building, made of grey granite, but unfortunately most of them are gone. This is because during the Middle Ages and during the Renaissance, materials of the buildings of the past used to be taken, reused and recycled for the construction of new monuments. Look at the Colosseum, a great view and a great spot for your pictures during your trip. From the terrace where we are now, during Easter the Pope has a very famous celebration. There is the re-enactment of the passion of Jesus that's what we call, Via Crucis, and he starts from here. To the right side of the Colosseum, that is the Arch of Constantine, built in the 4th century AD, to celebrate the first Christian Emperor. Looking back, we can have a look at the internal decoration of the Temple of Venus and Rome. The Temple was made of two absces, one facing the Colosseum and one facing the Forum. The one facing the Forum has been included into the Church of Santa Francesca Romana, so this is the only one left right in front of you. There were statues inside these absces depicting the two goddesses, Venus and Rome. Look at the structure of the building, you see just bricks, but you have to imagine that everything used to be colorful and covered in amazing marble. Imagine the floors, imagine the walls, it had to be shining and colorful. You will see many holes in the walls, and that's because of the metal clamps that were removed when those pieces of marble were taken to be recycled. Looking back, an amazing view over the Colosseum through the ruins. The place where we are now used to be included in the famous House of Nero, in the famous Golden House. You probably heard of Emperor Nero, he is the one that according to the tradition burned to the city of Rome in the year 6480. At the end of that fire he rebuilt a massive house, exactly here. The place where the temple stands today is the place where the statue of Nero used to be located, the famous Colossus of Nero. When the temple had to be built, Emperor Hedgen moved the statue away, using 24 elephants, and moved it close to the Colosseum. The name of the statue was Colossus of Nero, and that's why we call the Colosseum so. The architect of the Temple of Venus in Rome was probably Apollodoro from Damascus. The architect argued many times with Emperor Hedgen. You have to know that Emperor Hedgen was an architect too, in fact he designed his own villa in the city of Tivoli, that's what we call Hedgen's villa. Hedgen invented a new type of dome, and when the architect Apollodoro looked at the new kind of dome, he called it a pumpkin. Emperor Hedgen was not that happy, so the emperor exiled the architect and then condemned him to death. Let's move back to the beginning of the forum. To the left in a moment will appear again the arch of Titus that we just saw. Remember that the Roman forum that we are about to discover today was the political, religious and economic center of the ancient city of Rome. You have to imagine this area crowded, full of people. Everybody used to come to this area to make business, to discuss about politics or to worship their gods, so imagine it a lively place in the middle of the city of Rome. We are taking now one of the main roads, an old Roman road, the so called Via Sacra, sacred road. This is the road that the emperors had to take to conclude their triumphs. Remember the celebration that they could have at the end of a victory. To celebrate a triumph they had to build an arch, they had to pass down that arch, they had to take the sacred road, walk in through the Roman forum and they had to arrive at the end, in front of the temple of Jupiter on top of the capital line hill, and there they had to make a final sacrifice. But that triumph could be obtained only if they had killed more than 5,000 enemies. If they had killed less, there was no more a triumph so they had no more the right to have the celebration with the procession. They could do just a sacrifice in front of the temple of Jupiter. The name of that celebration was Ovazio, that's from where comes the word standing ovation. We are now about to see another magnificent building, in front of you is the Basilica of Maxensius. Maxensius was an emperor of the 4th century AD, he was a pagan emperor. He was defeated by emperor Constantine, remember the first Christian emperor. Look at this incredible building, it's a massive one, try to imagine a big roof right above our heads, imagine columns, imagine nades, dividing the internal space of this building, and one more time, imagine marble on the floor, and marble against the walls. This building is called Basilica. Today when we think of a basilica we think of a religious place, think of the Basilica of Saint Peter. But in reality in the Roman times a basilica was a tribunal, was a political building, was used to discuss about politics, to judge people, it was used for these political purposes. This building in fact was used as a secretarium sanatus, was used to judge senators. You will see that this building is located a little bit apart from the main square of the forum, and this is because the senators needed a little privacy while they were judged. Look at the amazing structure, imaging statues located in those niches that you see in the apps. Walking all the way down, we will stop to have a look at the ceiling of these big domes. The ceiling in fact recalls in part the decoration of the Dome of the Pantion. In this basilica during summer we have an important event related to literature. So we love to come here, when is good time, and reuse these buildings for modern purposes. There is a building that now captures our attention. You have a quite modern building on top of a very peculiar material. That material is what we call tough stone. It's the stone that you would find visiting the catacombs along the up and way in Rome. And looking down, that is the original Roman level. Yes, because you have to imagine that Rome was built on several layers. The original Roman level is that low, but then with the time and century after century the level raised and raised and raised. And this is why today the modern level is so high. Going back through the basilica of Maxensius, the place where we are now exactly is the place where a big statue of Maxensius used to be. When Maxensius was defeated, and Constantine became emperor, this basilica changed name, so in some book guides you can still find both names Basilica of Maxensius or Basilica of Constantine. While Constantine here found a statue of the previous emperor. The statue was giant, it was colossus. It was colossal, big. The body of the statue was made of bronze, while the head, the hands, the arms, the legs and the feet were made of marble. While Constantine could not leave the statue of the enemy inside, so he just cut the head of the statue and replaced it with his own one in marble. In the middle ages the bronze of the body was melted down and we lost it, but the pieces in marble were left and rediscovered during the excavation of the archaeological area. So visiting today, the museum on top of the capital lion hill, you would see the head of Constantine made of marble. Going back to the main road, to the Via Sacra, we will start to move to the original area of the forum. As we were saying, today we are going to see many buildings dated to different ages of the Roman history. And this is because we divide the Roman history in three big ages. According to the tradition, the city of Rome was founded in the year 753 BC on top of the Palatine hill by King Ramelous. After Ramelous there were other six kings. After the kingdom age we had the republican age that ends with the murder of Julius Caesar. The successor of Caesar was Octavian Augustus, that became the first Roman emperor, starting in this way the final imperial age. To the right side you see now a portico dated to the 12th century, because you have to imagine that the Roman forum at the end of the Roman Empire was abandoned, the level raised and the area was used as a place of pastor and markets. Looking to the right side now appears in front of you an incredible temple, the temple of Ramelous. Ramelous in this case not the founder of Rome, but the son of Maxensius. Maxensius had a son that died very young so decided to celebrate him having a temple dedicated to him in the forum close to his basilica. This temple dates to the 4th century AD. The door and the two beautiful columns next to it are still original. The temple is quite well preserved because it was converted in the Middle Ages in a church. This is what happened to many of the buildings of the Roman forum. Many were just taken, destroyed to reuse the material of them, but many others were repurposed and turned into churches. In front of you now in a moment another incredible building. This building is the temple of Antoninos and Faustina. It was a temple dedicated to Antoninos, the Emperor and Faustina, the wife, dated to the 141 AD. Look at the amazing podium and the beautiful stairway to get to it, the beautiful columns, but if you look behind them you can distinguish a green door and looking carefully all the way up you can identify the facade of a church. This is because in the 11th century a church was built inside a temple and the shape of the church that you see today dates to the end of the 1500s and beginning of the 1600s. Exactly as I was telling you many buildings were repurposed. As you can see we are now walking in a flat area. This is the original forum, the date to the 7th century BC. You have to imagine everything paved with amazing marble and exactly as you see it at the open air. Turning left we are going to see now another incredible building, the temple of the Divine Julius. The structure that you see was in reality the basement of the temple dedicated to Julius Caesar. In front of you the stones were according to the tradition the body of Caesar was cremated. Caesar was assassinated on the Ides of March, the 15th of March of the 44 BC and as I was telling you before, his death brought to the imperial age. Julius Caesar is considered a dictator and is loved by all Romans. Every year on the 15th of March we come here to the forum and we celebrate Caesar. The temple was built by Octavian Augustus in the year 29 BC on top of the place of his cremation so we consider it his tomb. We are now in the central piazza. You may imagine that this area was in reality a swamp. When the kings understood that the Palatine hill where the city of Rome had started was not sufficient anymore for an increasing population for a growing city, they moved down the hill and they decided to drain all this area, creating the first sewer of Rome. Think that sewer is still working today. In that moment the piazza was created and it was paved. It was the 600 BC. To your left side stands a lonely column that's the column of foca, is the last thing erected in the forum in the 608 AD. It was erected to remember an important event and is the moment in which the pantheon was converted into a church. In front of you appears now another incredible building. It is the famous Curia Giulia Senate House. It was the Senate. Started to be built by Julius Caesar but it was then inaugurated by Octavian Augustus in the year 29 BC. The shape that you see today is the shape given by Emperor Dioclation in the 3rd century AD, after a big fire that struck the forum. The Curia has been restored in the 1930s and it was transformed in a church in the Middle Ages. It was the Church of St. Hadrian. The bronze main door that used to be in the Senate is today one of the main doors of the Church of St. John in Lettron. In front of you, incredible ruins of the Republican Age of another important building that we are about to discover. It is, in fact, the Basilica Emilia. Another Basilica, another tribunal, another court of justice. This basilica is interesting because it's the only Republican basilica left in the forum. Looking to the left side you see the pieces of the columns that used to divide the internal naives. Try to imagine that it was possible to divide in more internal environment this basilica thanks to some curtains that could be placed in between the columns. The shape, in fact, recalls a lot of basilica as we intended today, so a church. To the right, the side wall of the building and look now through the arch at the amazing view. You can see the external portico that was added by Octavian Augustus during the Imperial Age. Keep in mind that many of the activities that were made in the Roman Forum at the open air could be moved inside this basilica if the weather was not good. In front of you stands the side wall of the Temple of Antoninos and Faustina that we just saw. You can see the blocks of stones and you see the holes because of those metal glens that were taken reused. The same for the marble that used to decorate the entire wall. Going back to the main piazza we take the sacred road one more time and we're going to see now the other side of the Roman Forum. As we were saying, all these areas being completely changed during the Kingdom Age, but many other buildings were added during the Republican Age and then during the Imperial Age. When the Roman Empire fell, it was the year 476 AD according to the tradition, all these areas were abandoned. Look at the floor, imagine it paved with beautiful marble and look into the right you see again the sacred road that we're going to take. When you hear kiosks, money changes, imagine places where people could come. This was the central area of Rome. Moving all the way down, we're going to see now another important building to the left, the Julia Basilica. Another basilica, we will see it from the inside in a moment. Unfortunately today what is left is the basement with the entrance with these stairways to your left side and some of the internal columns. You're going to imagine that the building was a two-story building. In front of you, one of the seven columns that were placed here along the Forum, on top of those pedestals there were columns and on top of the columns there were statues in bronze that unfortunately are all gone. In front of you, the ending part of the Forum appears again to you right now, the column of foca and all the way down what you see going up on a hill, that's the Capitol Line hill. The yellow building that appears at the end of the Forum with the bell tower on the top that is the town hall of Rome. It has been restored as you see it today in the Renaissance and imagine it was Michelangelo that gave to it the final shape. In front of you, the magnificent Temple of Saturn. It's a temple that I think was inaugurated in the 498 BC. It is giant in its shape, look at the basement, the walls are very thick. This building was probably the Treasury of Rome. This means that it was used to store all the coins and all the treasures of the whole city. Look at the people compared to the basement of it that gives you a scale of the shape of this building. In front of you to the right you see a building with a triangular roof that is again the Curia Julia that we already saw, the Senate House. Now I'm about to show you an incredible building that believe it or not in the Middle Ages was transformed into a barber shop. It's a building that these areas in the Middle Ages became a place of pastures, markets and well even a place of barber shops. The barber decided to install his shop in the central arch of the arch of Septimius Severus right in front of you. It's an arch built to celebrate the emperor Septimius Severus, we're talking of the 3rd century AD, and it was built to celebrate his victory against barbarians. And at the top you see an inscription with a hole in the middle of it. There was the bedroom that the barber opened on top of his shop to make sure that nobody could steal his place during the night. In front of you the beautiful columns that are decorating the frontal part of the Temple of Saturn. The temple has been restored many times even in the 49 BC. We're taking now the main Roman road and as you can see it goes all the way up. In front of you the Temple of Vespasian and Titus. It was a temple built to honor emperor Vespasian. When the sun Titus died the temple was dedicated to both of them and it was completed by emperor Domitian the second son of Vespasian. So it's a temple that is talking about the same family, the so called Flavian dynasty. That is an important family because it's the family that started and completed the construction of the Colosseum. Domitian the emperor that completed the temple is the emperor that added the undergrounds to the Colosseum. As you can see we continue moving up to the capital line hill. In front of you appears a columnade with 12 columns probably dedicated to the most important gods of the Roman times. There were probably statues related to those gods and they were located in those niches that you see right behind the columnade. Look at the amazing view, the temple of Saturn in front of you now with those beautiful 8 columns left. And in front of you the Basilica Iulia we are getting there in a moment. On top of the capital line hill so more or less where we are now here used to be the temple of Jupiter. So this is the place where the emperor is at to come to conclude their triumph. To the left side the building in yellow and grey that is for the yellow part of the town hall as we were saying and the grey part is the so called tabularium. So was the building used as archive for all the documents in Rome. It was built in the year 78 BC. In front of you the building in pink that looks pretty new is a church, is a church of Saint Joseph of the Carpenters. That church is important because it was built on top of the Marmortain prison, the ancient prison of Rome. According to the tradition Saint Peter and Saint Paul were imprisoned there before they were executed during the Christian persecutions. And here we are again looking at the magnificent Roman Forum that spreads right in front of our eyes. To the right the giant basement of the temple of Saturn and now we are getting close to the ruins of the Basilica Julia. Looking in front of you you will see pieces of the temples and of the buildings that were found during the excavation of the area especially let's focus on these big columns. I want you to look at them and compare people to them so that you can have a good scale of all these areas. Imagine to touch them too as this man is doing. You would have felt the granite of the column. And now we are about to enter the Basilica Julia, a basilica that started to be built by Julius Caesar but unfortunately he was killed so the basilica was then completed by Octavian Augustus, his successor. According to the tradition the basilica was in reality created on top of a previous republican basilica and the republican basilica itself was built on top of another incredible building, the house of Scipio. Scipio is the important Roman soldier in general that defeated Hannibal in the Cartagenaeans wars. Again of this basilica we have just a few columns left of the original five names that they used to make the basilica. In front of you you can see three big columns. They were part of another incredible temple of the Roman Forum. It was the temple of Castor and Pollux. Castor and Pollux are two gods coming from the Greek mythology, then included into the Roman mythology. According to the tradition they were sons of Lida and the Swan. The Swan was in reality Jupiter under the shape of a swan that seduced Lida. Lida instead of having children had two eggs and from those eggs came out Castor, Pollux, Helen of Troy and Clytemnestra. So it's a nice myth and you probably heard of it many times. The temple was built on the spot where the two gods according to the Roman tradition appeared. The temple was inaugurated in the 484 BC. The place where we are now is a good place to take a rest during your tour in the Roman Forum. In front of you the building with the triangular roof is a church, is the church of Santa Maria Antigua that dates to the 7th century. It was built on top of some of the buildings related to the imperial residence. Coming back to the main piazza we're going to discover more of these incredible areas. Looking to the left side you can still distinguish the steps of the entrance of the Basilica Julia and think on these steps were found some graffitis. They were called tabulellusorie. They were board games that Romans used to play while waiting here in the Forum. Turning to the right let's continue in the main piazza. Look now at the floor again remember it was all paved in incredible marble. Now let's imagine to walk down a big arch that was created by Octavian Augustus because we are about to discover now another incredible building. In front of you is the temple of Vesta. It was a circular temple on the dome on the roof there was a hole in the middle of it because the temple was created to preserve a sacred fire. So the smoke could go out through the hole on top of the roof and imagine the fire had always to burn because it was representing the life of the city. There were six Vestal Virgins. They were priestesses in charge of the fire and they had to spend their life watching the fire making sure it was always burning. The Vestal Virgins had the right to live in the Roman Forum so in a moment we are going to discover the house of the Vestal Virgins. Imagine six Vestal Virgins chosen among the most important families of Rome they had the right to live here. This was their main garden imagine it surrounded by a portico to the left the statues of the most important Vestal Virgins. They had to spend their life here 30 years of their life watching the fire of the temple. If they were caught making some mistakes watching the fire they were whipped and imagine they had to live in chastity for the 30 years. If they were caught having a lost story having an affair they were killed. They could not be killed directly so they used to be brought outside of the city of Rome they were walled up in a cave and left with some food. In this way they were not physically killed but put in the condition to die. Imagine this building completely decorated with amazing marble as always all gone lost in the time. Many pools in the middle of the gardens and imagine that this house was absolutely self sufficient so here in this house the Vestal Virgins had a bakery, a milestone, vegetable garden and a kitchen. At the end of the 30 years they were free. Consider that these ladies had many rights compared to the other ladies of the Roman society. They had special seats in the places for shows. If they met a senator in the middle of the way the senator had to stop to let them go and if they met a person that was condemned to death they could set that person free. In this house we found some heating systems and this makes us think that this house was a luxurious one. So the Vestal Virgins were very special women in the ancient Roman time but consider they had a very hard life. The order of the Vestal Virgins ended with the arrival of Christianity and there were no more ladies available to become Vestal Virgins at the condition of spending 30 years of their life watching a fire in the Roman Forum. So with the arrival of Christianity many of these pagan religions started to disappear. In front of you the Temple of Romulus that we already saw coming till here. And you can now distinguish right on top of it a cross as we were saying the Temple was converted into a Christian building. It's now interesting to understand what happened to the Roman Forum at the end of the Roman Empire. As we were saying the Roman Empire officially ends in 476 AD. Many were the causes that brought to the end of the empire. Probably the most famous one is the arrival of the Barbarians. When the Roman Empire ended all these areas stopped to exist. The Roman Forum was completely abandoned, was no more the center of the Roman world. So try to imagine that all these areas were completely left and nobody was taking care of it. Floods, dust, wind, rain made it possible to deposit dirt and the level started to raise. This is why many buildings were buried. At the end of the 1800s with the unification of Italy all these areas started to be rediscovered and excavated. In front of you you have a very peculiar building that has nothing to see with the Roman Forum. Those buildings are related to the so called Ortifarnesiani, the Farnese gardens. They were created in the 1500s and were created by Alexander Farnese, the nephew of Pope Paul III. You have to imagine a complex of terraces, gardens and areas related to the entertainment of this family. So was the place for banquets, for parties. Try to imagine this area was so abandoned that in the 1500s, popes could take it. Let's move all the way up so we are getting now to another Roman road. Try to imagine that this area was abandoned after the Renaissance and rediscovered with the groundwork at the end of the 1700s beginning of the 1800s. Here we are, walking on another Roman road. Is this so called Via Nova New Road? The name was given to it to distinguish it from the Sacred Road Via Sacra built before. All the Roman roads were made exactly in this way. The black stone is basalt, it's a volcanic stone. You have to imagine that 20,000 years ago we had a volcano here. So we had many eruptions during the centuries and this stone was common and cheap even in the Roman times. So Romans decided to pave all the roads throughout the empire in this specific way. This stone, being a volcanic one, is perfect to stop fires. And as you can see in between the stones there is some space left that was made to make it possible to drain water during rain or floods. The big treff in the Roman times were fires and floods. So this is the secret of Romans and of their roads, remember, all roads lead to Rome. Let's move down these big arches following the Via Nova because in a moment we will be at the bottom of the Palatine Hill, the place of the foundation of Rome. But even the place where the emperors decided to build their palaces. Was Emperor Octavio Augustus that decided to have his imperial palace on top of the Palatine Hill. He did it because he wanted a special connection with the Ramulus, the founder of Rome, that started the creation of the city right on top of that hill. Octavio Augustus built his palace. It was a small one, but the emperors that arrived after him wanted their palaces too on top of the same spot. So the Palatine Hill, at the end of the Roman Empire, was a full of big imperial palaces. Start to have a look at the beautiful view and going up on top of the Palatine Hill, I promise you will have a great, marvelous view. Just to give an idea, we are now at the bottom of the Palatine Hill. Look at these arches. They were built to sustain a big palace that had to be right on top of the terrace that we just saw. The palace that was there was the palace of Tiberius. So was considered to be the palace of the successor to the emperor. Octavio Augustus, named as the first successor, his nephew, Marcellus. Unfortunately he died, so Octavio Augustus named other two nephews as successors. They were Lucius and Gaius. And they died too. We don't really know what happened. We know that the only one left that he could name emperor was Tiberius, the son of the wife of Octavio Augustus, Livia, but the son coming from the first wedding. Well Octavio Augustus named Tiberius successor. And that's how Tiberius became the second Roman emperor. Let's move up this big ramp. It's a ramp created by emperor Domitian, remember the third emperor of the Flavian dynasty. He created this ramp in the 1st century AD to have a great entrance to the imperial residence. So this was the way the emperors could get to the Palatine Hill and they could enter their house. From here you will enjoy an amazing view. And there are even some panels where you can find the description of what you see. You can enjoy the view from here and recognize most of the buildings that we already saw. Look at the town hall all the way down, the arch of Cetimius Severus, the temple of Castor and Pollux, the temple of Antoninus and Faustina right in front of you, the temple of Ramelus, the house of the Vestal Virgins. That is the terrace, where used to be the palace of Tiberius. If you will visit the Palatine Hill, that terrace will be amazing for pictures. A last look before we move all the way back. To the left side, that is the Palatine Hill. You can see that today on top of it we have just trees and gardens, but you have to major it full of palaces, the houses of the emperors. Those palaces were unfortunately destroyed during the Middle Ages and during the Renaissance, specifically by the Popes. They were reused for their materials. During the construction of St. Peter's Basilica, many of the materials were taken from those palaces. That's why today, on top of the Palatine Hill, we don't have much left. According to the tradition, the city of Rome started on the Palatine Hill. Ramelus, as we were saying, was the first king. He had a twin brother called Rimas. They decided to build their own city. Ramelus on top of the Palatine Hill, now to our right side, Rimas on top of the Alventine Hill. They had an agreement. They could not enter the city of the brother. They had to stay in their own one. Rimas didn't follow the agreement. Enter the city of Ramelus and Ramelus killed him. This is why we call the city of Rome so. The beginning of everything so is said on the 21st of April of 753 BC. We don't know why that day. But we celebrate every year on the 21st of April, the birthday of Rome. Going back to the Via Nova, we walk down these arches. These arches were built by Emperor Hadrian to move forward the entrance of the imperial palaces from the Palatine Hill closer to the Roman Forum. Try to imagine that along this road there were many shops, the so-called taberni. Remember always that the Forum was a commercial area, was a place of markets, and a place for business. All the way ahead, you can now distinguish clearly the arch of Titus, the whistle at the very beginning of our tour. Many were the artists and the poets that fell in love with this special area. Think of Goethe, think of Stendhal. They came here on the Palatine Hill and admired the landscape and wrote about what they could see and the feelings that all this area could give to them. An area that was talking about an older civilization that created so much and left so much to all of us. Look at the beautiful trees in front of you. We call them umbrella trees. They are Mediterranean pine trees and they grow like this. Taking the road again to the right side you would follow up to the Palatine Hill. So one day, when coming, you can decide to move all the way up and see that part. But we are going back to the left side and we have the arch of Titus in front of us again and the beautiful bell tower of the Church of Santa Francesca Romana. Just notice how the arch of Titus is so high compared to the level where we are walking. The floor where we are walking dates to the time of Octavian Augustus. It's because of a mistake during the excavations that took place at the end of the 1800s beginning of the 1900s. Some of the Roman levels were by mistake destroyed and removed. Moving ahead you can hear follow the signs toward the exit and moving we can follow this little path and look at the tree to our left side. This is a laurel tree. Laurel leaves were used for the crowns of the emperors during the Trials. So you will see many important trees during your tour here in the Forum. For example in front of you you have an olive tree. They were sacred trees in the Roman times. The big basilica of Maxensius in front of you that we are about to leave, we are taking the exit to the right side. But don't worry we have a couple of things to see before we end our tour. Be careful with this tricky exit. You have just to push a little strong. And we are out. Let's move to the right side. There is one more thing that I really would like to show you. And it's something that we already named in reality before. It is the basilica of Santa Francesca Romana. This church is extremely old. The first time it was built was the 9th century. It has been then re-created to Francesca Romana in the 1500s. Francesca Romana is a Roman saint that lived in Rome in the 1400s. The church has been restored in the 1600s in a baroque style and that's what you see today. Look at the amazing ceiling. The dates to the 1600s. The church has been restored and Bernini was in charge of an important statue representing the saint for the altar. Unfortunately the statue has been taken. This church is extremely famous and is used today for weddings. Let's leave it. And let's go back to the external area of this archaeological site. I'm going to bring you to the metro station. So from there you'll be ready to move on for other incredible adventures in Rome. Before doing it, think of what we just saw. An incredible old area of Rome that we can consider the real beginning of a civilization. Walking on the Roman road again, we will see the external part of the basilica of Max Sanctius to our left. To the right, the church of Santa Francesca Romana. But look, while turning in a moment, another incredible building is going to appear in front of your eyes. Right behind those trees we have the Colosseum, the symbol, the icon of Rome. As we all know, the Colosseum is the place that was created for shows and entertainment. Remember, it's the Flavian dynasty that built it. Emperor Vespasian, the father, started the construction that was then completed by the first son Titus. Domitian, the second son, is the one that added the undergrounds. Before the construction of the Colosseum, the shows, the gladiator fights, took place in the Roman Forum. We've also found some elevators in the undergrounds of the Forum that were used so that gladiators could pop up in the middle of the piazza. Looking to your left, you see many works going on. And look to the right, those are the columns apart of the Temple of Venus in Rome that we just saw. As you can see, the Erase and the Works. This is because the city of Rome is trying to create a new subway line. The works are endless and we don't know when they will finish. Look in front of you, the Colosseum. Standing. Proud. After quite 2,000 years. This is the best part of the building. Moving around of it, you will see that a lot of the construction has gone. Fail. Mainly because of earthquakes, but in part even because it has been reused and recycled. As the rest of the buildings that we saw in the Roman Forum. We were talking about the statue of Nero, the Colossus of Nero, that was moved close to the building. Well, look to the right, do you see all those people sitting? That is the place where the Colossus of Nero was moved. What happened to that statue? Well, we have no idea. It was bronze, so probably it was melted down and recycled for something else. Look in front of you, 3 lines of arches. The original name of the Colosseum was in reality Flavian Amphitheater. And the name as we already said changed because of the statue of Nero. The road that we are about to cross is the road of the Imperial Forums, created in the 1930s. And here we are at the metro station. I hope that you enjoyed our tour together. And I wait for you for other incredible adventures. Enjoy your day.
