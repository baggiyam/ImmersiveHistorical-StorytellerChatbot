 on Hello everyone, we are here at the Colosseum together with Frederico. Hello guys, Frederico from Rome, I will be your guide today and we are going to visit what's our symbol. Colosseum, the biggest ampitidae ever built, quite big and we are going to also analyze the difference between new, older stadiums and we are going to have this trip between bricks, columns, archaeology, a lot of variation stuff. Nice, let's go Frederico. Let's go, let's go. We are down using those stairs. Yes. So are the roads here the same as they used to be during the ancient times? Well actually not much, Rome is a very old city, it's been rebuilt many many times but there are some roads that still preserve the ashen route and we are actually close to one of those because the ones that we can see over there. It's new, it's being made during the 20s by our former potato Mussolini, used with the Colosseum for propaganda for rallies, big speeches. Right, just like Caesar, right? Yeah, more or less. So today's story rebuked itself, right? Yeah, same mindset. Yeah, Colosseum is a big propaganda building at the end of the day. The most famous bread and cereal stuff. For the Romans here is a chateaume for social control, to keep the people happy. So that's why they spend so much money in the stadium at the end of the day. And that's the other thing we start from there, the traffic light. All right. That still is, we cannot see very much from here but it still has the ashen route, so it's the... It's ugly. And that goes to San John Lateran Basilica, but we are going to cross the street, the Mussolini Street. We enter the side of Colosseum, you can see that a lot of public works. I'm gonna walk on the other side. Yeah, sure. Okay, let's go on the left. That's today's for pedestrian. Back then, two years ago, you could drive this road, drive this road many, many times in my life. Used to say that the Colosseum was the most beautiful roundabout worldwide. Not anymore. Not anymore. It's a big pedestrian area. So let's go right. Okay, good afternoon. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. So we're going to see a much less busy version of the Colosseum, but this used to be one of the most visited monuments in the world, imagine a busy day. For example, today we are in late June, so it's totally hike season. Even with Corona? No, with Corona there is nobody. Back then up to 30,000 people could enter daily in the Colosseum. That's a lot. Yeah, it was by far the most visited monument of Italy. Imagine that the queue could arrive till that Arcia Trium, the Arcia Constantin. The tallest and the best preserved of our Arcia Triums. So I've read that all these arches were filled with statues of warriors or some kind of important people. Is that correct? It's correct actually. That's what we think because the sources, the books, described the Colosseum being decorated with those two meter tall marble statues representing generals, divinities, heroes, important personalities, for the Roman culture. Obviously those are hypotheses because we don't have, for example, a coin not with the statues. We don't have representation with those statues, so it's an hypothesis, let's say. For example, same books explained that on the very top of the Colosseum there were big bronze shields made of golden bronze. And that's an hypothesis because good part of the decoration, the statues, the marble, the lead, the bronze, the metal, everything that could be sucked, exploited from the Colosseum in those 2000 years has been removed, reused. And so today we're going to see the skeleton, what remains of the Colosseum. One third of the material that used to compose the entire structure back in the time, back in the 80 AD when this monument, this amphitheater, has been inaugurated. Now masks on. So let's admire what remains of the Colosseum. So here you are imaging like a big crowd of people who lost 50 to 60,000 persons, the Colosseum. So here you are imaging people that sell food, or for example, placing some bet, or yeah, just be here with your friends. It was a place, it was a big event the day of the Colosseum. So there were something like 70, 80, some years, 100 days of games that was all complementary. So it was like a big party when there was the Colosseum. The day of the game in the Colosseum was a full day event. So you can imagine this area was. A morning till dusk. Exactly. So it was very, very crowded, the entire area of the Colosseum. Okay. Okay, so let's go straight. You can see the Colosseum is very dirty inside, because the Colosseum has been made with this rub sand called the Chavatin, so a full round stone which tend to absorb pollution, especially. And so this part on the left has been cleaned years ago, has been also very cost-efficient, 24 millions of euro for the first floor or only the outside? Only for the cleaning the extent of the facade. So plus some maintenance work and part of the private sector finance, this operation, especially big brands of fashion, of Italy. Those are the ones that spend money to clean, to preserve the city, for example, Bulgaria cleaned these Spanish steps. Fendi cleaned and today use the EUR district, which is beautiful this is a part of Rome built by the regime, but indeed a beautiful piece of art, of architecture. And Todd's, this brand of shoes, they spent something like four millions out of those 24. Okay. Exactly, so he contributed for the cleaning of the Colosseum, but as you can see the internal part deserves some spring clean less. Yeah, looks pretty black. And now we are going this direction. And now we're going to enter a special part of the Colosseum, which is not accessible to everybody. Because we're going to walk on the stage, on the arena stage of the Colosseum. I'm excited. And here there are some peculiar things. First of all, we can walk on the ground level, which has been repaired partly. We can see the only part of the only staircase still intact in the whole monument. This is the original. Exactly, because good part of the stairs were actually taken and reused for other monuments. Colosseum has been a big quarry during the middle age to reuse the materials. So that's why part has been repaired. And here, in modern times, we decided to kind of suggest to the visitor which was the shape of the Colosseum when it was all intact. Because here we can see this big wall, which is the wall that sustained the external facade of the Colosseum. Sustained the two fifth of the external facade is the standing. Because the part of the Colosseum, the external part, collapsed for a number of reasons, especially earthquakes. Earthquakes, yeah. Okay, so here you can see the main entrance door. So this was the main entrance door. There were four main entrances. All right, huge main entrances. With different kind of utilization, let's say. This particular door, because this door is called the Porta Libi Dinensis, and was more exit door rather than an entrance door. But let's enter to see why. All right, Federica. Okay, so good. Here we can see all the underground structure. We can see, well, actually many interesting things. For example, we can see the original paving of the Colosseum, which is this opus spiccato, like this earring bone. Those are all bricks. Ah, really? That white one? Yeah, this one. There is the humidity. So this is all the paving, the original one. And we can also see channels in the stones. What are channels? Those channels are the ones that were used to insert the frame of those famous elevators. They were placed in the underground part of the Colosseum to create this famous surprise effect. So basically what those persons used to do, the persons used to store all the animals in those small holes, those arches. There are 30 of those. Okay, so over there, you mean the small holes there? This, that's a two level area. No? So basically there are 60 animals at the same time, could be stored in the underground part, down stage of the Colosseum. And released simultaneously. And you cannot release them simultaneously, but most of the time the slaves, those 200, 300 slaves that we used to work in the underground part of the Colosseum, used to carry those big cages, fill those internal corridors. And now through a system of purulis, they managed to elevate those animals to the arena level, creating this famous surprise effect. And here we can see a reproduction of an elevator. Something like this. I don't know if you can see. Yeah, I'll put one in the link as well. I'm not sure if it's clear, but it looks interesting. Two levels, slaves, the purulis and the lions that could exit. Imagine being a gladiator here. Mix that feeling, because there was maybe somebody in his own pant, and maybe somebody which was maybe more experienced. So it was not maybe scared at all. Who knows? Well, we know that it was a very spectacular kind of show. And to create this surprise, the wall stage was covered with a material, the sand, because the sand basically sucked the blood up. So what the Romans used to do with this sand, they used to cover the wall stage. And that's curious, because the Latin name for sand is arena. I didn't know that. Spanish language, for example, still preserved the actual Latin word. One is the Italian, Dutch, English, today to us an arena. It's a place for entertainment, basically. It's a stadium most of the time. But the name derived from this material used to suck the blood up, but also to hide the system of traptors. So how was the platform formed? Like wooden? Yeah, it was made of wood, oak, and everything was covered. Today we just rebuilt one fort, and that's to give you the chance to see what's under the ground. New project will be to extend this arena level till covering the wall perimeter of the stadium, since society that managed the Colosseum wants to make more money out of it. In this case we can sell the tour of the underground part separately, and you can also organize concerts and stuff, events over here. Everything has an economic model behind it, right? That's why we guide, we are very, very against this operation, right? Yeah. Because for us the Colosseum must be used only for educational purposes. There we can see reconstruction of the seats. Oh wow. Using the original stones. Those are kind of not very accurate. This has been made by Mussolini, that used this monument for his propaganda purposes. Also for events and stuff? Also for events, big speeches and stuff like that. And so we can see original stones with the name of the senators which own that particular seat. But to be honest I don't imagine a senator sitting in this very small space. So that's why I think Mussolini was much better as a speaker, rather than as an archaeologist. That's why this can be more a recolocation of material than a reconstruction, because there wasn't a study behind. So where was the emperor's seat? Emperor's seat actually over there. We can see what's remain of this stage. So you can see just the skeleton. But we know that this probably is the stage of the emperor for one evidence. The fact that the underground port of the Colosseum got many many tunnels. And this, have a tunnel that end up that direction, heading the Palatine Hill, the Temple of Cleo Cloudius. So this side. So it was kind of a security exit. Because imagine that here there were 50,000, 60,000 people. But also the senators, the best of the worst, those best alvergines, all the most important people of the empire, was watching the show together. So that was also to stick social classes. So that's why if today at the stadium in Rome, Rome Alazio, dangerous game, we employ maybe 1000, 1200 policemen. Here there were up to 3000 soldiers. Pretorians also, the private guard of the emperor. Because the security measures were very very strict. The fact that there was the emperor, their family. And just the emperor and their family could sit over here. Pulvinar, that's the name of this place. On the first rank, right? The first rank, the first rank. Pulvinar, that's the name of this place. On the first rank, right? Most close to the battle. Exactly, there was another canopy on the top. To protect the emperor from the sun. Just like in Gladiator. Exactly. So over there you could defend the emperor. But there was another stage, over the side, over there where the cross is. Where you could have found, for example, the organ... In all the important people. Most of the time you could have found the editor. So the person who sponsored us. Even since this is the imperial stadium, the imperial and the good part of the time was the emperor that was financing this show. That was totally for free. How many levels does this thing consist? You can see, my level over here. The sanatorium level. VIP section. Then behind, you can see the net. The concrete, the black concrete. Obviously there wasn't a real middle class. So let's say that the first level, they were the rich people politicians. And behind, rich people, still, but that decided to don't enter in politics and just to care about their businesses. For example. Then where those personnel were working, that was an internal corridor. Because you'd never see... You could see basically seats. And behind, you could find the middle class, the working class. Average Roman citizens. Then the wall with windows. Another section between the windows. And that... The big stage. And the big level over there. With terrace. And on that terrace, you see that on wooden seats the unimportant. The people who are breaking people. People that could not participate. The cheapest tickets like today. Exactly. More or less, things that didn't change that much. Right. Let's go to explore other parts. But now we have to exit. And we have to exit through this door. That was called the Porta Libitinensis. Libitina was this goddess of the gravestones, no? So, goddess related to the death. So, I can imagine that if you exit from this door, it's not very good news for you. No. Normally, the people exit from here. Stones. Inside there. A lot of it is made in brick. And the rest is made in the other material. I guess. The external frame. So, made with this material. The travel thing. We have great abundance of this. Just like the Netherlands. Also Italy was all under the water. Historical era. And this what happened. We called the calcium. It's sediment. Calcium. No. Stick together. Melted together, I would say. I think that's what the Romans invented. No, no, no. This is because, basically, the pressure of the ocean made the calcium very compact. Also the Montranos Central Italy, that before we were all under the water, basically, are full of this great abundance of this. Tiburinum. That was the Latin name for this. And we have this city close to Rome. Tivoli. I don't know why, when I go on vacation, Tivoli either. Tivoli Park. But Tivoli means the city of the Tiburinum. The city of the travel time. It is situated north side of Rome. So the Roman could carve this stone using the river. They could transport this material to Rome. And the old external frame is made with this. Then the Tufa stone. This volcanic stone is very much used. The calcium. The volcanic stone that you can see left and right. It's a volcanic stone. So this basically all those volcanic ashes compressed. Ten minutes of Rome, for example, are made mostly this kind of stone. Tufa. And bricks, of course. Of course, Romans were a great producer of bricks. Rome exported bricks for many, many centuries. Especially during the imperial era. And now we date monuments in Rome. Because since all those bricks were... There is a stamp. There is the sign ball of the factory that produced that particular brick. And if we know that that factory operated in this particular time frame, that's how we managed to date part of the buildings. And then you can imagine the Croatian marble was very opulent for soon. It was the imperial imperial. For the most part. And now let's climb to the second level. We are going to turn left. Obviously there is also an elevator. Let's take the stairs. A modern one. Let's take the stairs. Those very steep steps. Look at those caps. Huge. Because these were remade in the 30s, building on top of the originals. And since the buildings on the top were a little bit taller than they used to be. You can notice you really have to lift your knee up. Exactly. I always say that the fitness is included in this theory. Cool. So, forgive my ignorance, but I don't think they had glass. The Romans, did they? They did. They did? Sorry. They had glass. We are going to see also some pieces of glass found close to the Colosseum. But the Romans could not reach very high temperatures, so the glass was always a little bit cloudy. It's not very transparent. But those condominium, the insule, those buildings in Rome, normally at the first level, which was the most the pricest one. Because in case of fire, you would escape. The cheapest apartments were the ones on the very top. And normally those apartments at the very top for the working class they don't have nothing. But the first level... No emergency exits. Exactly. But the first level, yes, they normally have glass. Windows. So this is like an example of how it would look like? Exactly. It has been made in the 1830. Because Colosseum, the history of Colosseum as a monument, started in the 19th century. When Italy was being invaded by France, French people were more advanced. Imagine that Rome was a confessional state. It was more similar to a medieval state rather than a modern one, like we understand that today. For example, in Rome, during those years, people were obliged to go to the mass on the Good Friday. And for example, it was a city that the prime minister came back home and maybe there were chickens in front of his house or ships. It was very backward. For example, it was a city where a Jewish guy would be taken in the night beaten up and forced to convert to Christianism. Confessional state. So the political leaders were priests. For them, this was a symbol that there is something different. There is a different way to live the life. Not only Christian Catholic. This is an example of a great society which belongs to totally different things. So, Colosseum has been used there for sacchurie, as many many things. When the French people were invaded by Italy, they created those republics in Italy. They arrived in Colosseum and they see a monument that was felling apart. Monument that was full of sediments. Monument that was used, vandalized basically. And they did a lot of studies for national things, but also death. And the French people were the first people that started to include the cultural heritage in the legislation. Let's say. The Ascian cultural heritage. Obviously, even Raphael has been called to supervise the Ascian ... Raphael? Exactly. He's been the first director of the Ministry of the Culture. Raphael, for example. So it's not that it was zero and then the French arrived. But for sure the French give a big impulse. No. Because the Sroma Mon were more exploited than preserved. Especially by the popes. I also see like there's a huge canopy. The Velarium. That they assumed was there. Exactly. Like for shade, I guess. Exactly. 240 wooden pylons. All connected with ropes. Maintained in tension. Just like a normal stadium has there, right? More or less, exactly. So the light pulled the stream from inside through this big hole. And as you can see, the cheapest place were all covered. While this another... No. So that's why we have a supplemental canopy. Strap doors. The pool is... Also this. Because that's a reproduction. It's a very accurate image of what you could have found the morning time in the Colosseum. Because what we saw on the documentary. No? The documentaries with few people fighting. Or movies. Like La Vieira, though it's not totally accurate. Because the Colosseum shows were a big mess. At the end of the day, it was always the same stuff. Like not really organized in that sense. Colosseum was following the same schedule, for example. Normally it... It started with this Pompamagna, so an opening ceremony. No? Then after that there was the game with the animals. With multiple animals at the same time. Fought against those hunters. Like Linatores. Hunters. Boars. And they got those from their empire in Egypt, I guess. Yeah, also Africa of course. Africa of course has been a big... The main spot to reach to... To... There was a big industry behind. The first one which had to hold the animals. The one that had to transport. The one that organized all the transactions. So it was a big industry, let's say. And that's why the Colosseum was helped. The organization of the events. By many other buildings. And over there we can see that archaeological area. Over there I don't know if you... But on the right can you see a small... Ampitheater. Small one here. On the right, right side. Right here. It's half of a circle. There are many parts of this circle. Circle is just under the road. So in the basement they still have what remains. So in the basement they still have what remains. But they still have what remains of this building. Which was something in between. A gym. But also a prison. Because that's the school of the gladiators. Especially used to live on the left side. There are small rooms, right? But it's difficult to understand. So I have a photo here that maybe can help us in the... It's so difficult to understand. Because I've seen some pictures, you know, Downstairs from how it has been. Yeah. And how it's obviously been. And how it's obviously now. And you can't really recognize anything really. It's really hard to imagine That hill was basically a huge... I don't know what it was. Fortification or temple or... It used to be a big house. Big palace. You wouldn't even see that today. Basically you see some remnants and that's it. Obviously the archaeological too. Required a bigger effort of imagination. Yeah. There's not much left. So you have a nice picture here. But here that's how it was to understand. Because we can see the castle and the temple. The archa triumph. Those pillars. Ah, you see the circle navigating the whole monument. So the ropes for the velarium were anchored to those pillars. To keep the velarium this... This seal intention. But here we can see one, two, three... Different kind of structure. Because all these areas were... Basically used for this purpose. Here we are number one. You can see what's in the name of this Buddhist Magnus. This school... That you brought at iPad. With some pictures. It really lifts up the imagination. 2,500 seats. Rooms for gladiators. Training pitch. Wow. Where Agai, the Lanista, is checking. If his own heart lit. Because they had to sign a contract with him. They are training properly. But what we can see in front of us is an imperial kind of gym. So it was... Run by the government, let's say. But they were ampitieders, but they were privates for gladiator. Most of them were private. They were Roman word. They were very private. It was all about the money at the end of the day. More than today. How much could they earn if they won? Sorry? How much could they earn? They earned renting the service of gladiators. They were... There was a big industry, though. They were the person who provided the animals. They were the ones who provided the people for the fighting. They were the ones who had to organize in general all the events. We could see that there are also someographies. We need the slaves. Slaves that have to operate at the those elevators. Yeah, we can see the counterweights of those elevators. But we can also see here the structure of the Colosseum, the different levels. Rich, rich. Poor, poor, poorest. So, let's say today the Colosseum would still be here. If you want to buy a ticket, how much would it cost? It was for free. Oh, right. Completely for everyone. No, for everybody. For example, for for foreign people. Non-Romans. In this case, normally you have to pay the ticket. We don't know how much it costs. Also, to me, it's difficult to speak about the Colosseum because Colosseum has a very long story. It has been maintained active from the 8080 till the 523 more or less. It's a very, very long history. And so, rights, organization, everything seems lost. Those are oil lumps. These are the animals that we found in the sewer system of the Colosseum. Ah, so that's how you know from chickens to ostriches. I prefer the ostrich. Then you mentioned the glass. Roman glass. That's right. That's a Roman glass of the third century. So I got 1,800 years the piece of glass. Amazing that it's still like that preserved. Here we can see the games of the Romans, board games, games. If all the stuff that we found, what the Roman haters, it's through it. All this stuff has been found nearby the Colosseum area. We can also see Cosrafini presenting the Venezian the haunting game, the morning time game. People killing the animals. Or, for example, the leaders. This guy. Mmm. You can see Ter on the top. We understood this Ter as a felici Ter. So it's like, probably this guy won. Or maybe the one that made this graffiti, won a big big money, on this guy. You can see also Nesmosaic. From Austin. And we can see those animals which were transporting the animals. Those guys were basically working at the port of Rome. So their job was to carry the animals from the port to the city center. There's those little zoos nearby the Colosseum. These are Ash and Mosaic, Black and White. Romans did like the television. So they went from Black and White to Colosseum. Little Permosaics are all very colorful. Points. That's the next exposition. Yeah, we can see statues. For example, all their coins, we don't see. We can see the shields. We can see it's with all the people. And this is an image. This is a coin which has been minted in the ATAD. The inauguration of the Emperor Tidus of the Colosseum. And I reckon the coin wasn't really that large. I'm not sure how large it is. But this is really detailed, right? Yeah, exactly. I mean, you can see this narrow or whatever they hold him. Romans were good money makers. But Greeks were better. The Romans minted. A lot of Greek people were working in Romans minting. But then, at some point, the Roman Empire collapsed. 476 is the conventional date of the Colosseum of the Roman Empire. And the Colosseum started another era for the Colosseum. Because what happened? A public invasion. Those people destroyed the aqueducts. Rome became a small town. 50,000 people. From 1.10 million, the very first metropolis in the history of humanity has been the very first city to reach 1 million people in the history. And it became a town. Basically. And all those Roman monuments started to be colonized by important powerful families. And the Colosseum became kind of a castle. That's why the state that we saw before is still preserved. Because it was the state that used to enter in this castle. So that's why this Francipani family didn't exploit that material. But the history of the Colosseum in the Middle Ages is very linked to the Christian Catholic Church. At some point became the owner. The Colosseum also has part of the history that has been used as a Congo, a Roman kingdom, a Catholic, that we can see all pottery from the Middle Ages. Because the Colosseum has been used also like a mall. Like there was the tailor shop, the blacksmith, the butcher. And that's the reproduction of the Colosseum in those years. Where at the con level there were the shops. And then also the houses of the people, homeless people that colonized those buildings. It's typically Rome. Many buildings, ancient Roman buildings suffer this kind of exploitation. I told you that the Christian Catholic Church became a owner of this place. So a congregation as well of own part of the Colosseum. And the Colosseum became very famous for those processions that held the good Friday Easter time. That's why at some point they even thought to build a church in the Colosseum. It's too bad it's not here today. We have more than 900 churches in Rome. It's a pretty unique site, right? In an arena to have a cathedral. Yeah, but I mean I prefer the Colosseum as an archaeological Roman site. Because it was a church in the Colosseum. You can see the description site. It's a place that controls the dispersion of the Colosseum. The dispersion was also managing the area inside the Colosseum. You don't want to build your own church, but to us, to those guys. But those are quite recent kind of images. Because they were all painted by this community of Danish people. Which lived in Rome in the beginning of the 19th century. The waltz and many, many of those under, many of those Danish people. Which gave us a representation how we could have found the Colosseum in those years. Behind, you can see a famous model made by an Italian architect. They spent 18 years in the Colosseum from the 72 to the 80. These guys spent 12 years to make the model of the Colosseum. It's from stone or? It's wood. It looks like stone. It's painted. It's highly detailed. 12 years. One person drawing. The last step of the history of the Colosseum. Here we can see how Mussolini used the big girl in front of the monument for his parade for this march. He tried to push the Italians in participating in this big war. The demonstration from the Nazi fascist occupation happened on the 5th of June 1944. Colosseum is also a museum. They are temporary expositions. Every now and then. Here there is this Pompeii exposition. Pompeii is one of the stories between Rome and Pompeii. That's a very nice role of the preserved wine. Here we can see the top. You can see all the Europe imaged by the Romans. The year 670, when the Roman Empire already collapsed. We can see Spain, Ireland, Britain, France. It's a really strange map to see it. Morocco. Where is Germany? Germany. Behard. Does it also include Africa? That's Libya. Of course this is the Mediterranean. Yes. Here we can see Croatia. Yes. Venice. Rome. Sicily. Are those red lines like the roads? The roads lead to Rome? The roads lead to Rome. Appian Way, Aurelia. What's this here? This should be the port of Rome. It's the port of Rome called the Portus. There was a road called the Portuensis. The road that goes to the port. Here we can see Sicily, Calabria. Calabria, Puglia. Greece. Very extensive knowledge of the world they have. Cyprus. Cyprus. And here we have Egypt. Egypt is this. Nowadays Israel is here. And here is Egypt. So, kill India. We can see. Nice. Not bad. Not bad at all. And that's this exposition in Pompeii. You can see the very first fighting at the stadium. The history. People beating up each other. Competition. It's like this position. The most important pieces are for example this. It's a micro mosaic. And see stones that are very very small. Original? Very rich Roman house. Rich guy. In Pompeii. Roman house. Another nice piece of art. The walls of Roman houses. Those Pompeii style. Here we can see an example of Roman paintings. Roman frescoes. Very small the characters. How are they like painted on? Is that stone or? Yeah, that's a fresco. It's a mix. It's like concrete. And they paint and they paint and they enter inside the wall. Pompeii for example here we can see important character that contributed to the development of Pompeii. So they reach the right of the image. So they could be honored by the citizens of Pompeii. Not through this the station. So they will be forever. Those were the ones that built the ampit either. The one that has some credits. There is a video of the eruption of Pompeii. So this is very interesting. That's what will be for the next video. I will put a sort of video in the link. Exactly. So the outside arrangement. Finally we reach our spot. That's the working class section of the station. It's pretty impressive. This obviously was an internal corridor. Not really like with a roof and stuff. Exactly. Those were all patches. Staircases. Staircases were at some point were closed. For security reasons. You never see the original plaster of the Colosseum. The ground level was all covered with marble. It was reused and recycled. But it was very well decorated. But that's the working class section. So that's why it just plastered. We can see those vaults made of concrete. Normally the Romans mixed the concrete with that to fast stones. So basically this was the top seats of the people. They were made of travertine. Like a lot of steps. Even a rebuild. This also has been let's say repaired. There's not much of the original pavement over here. Otherwise you couldn't even walk here I guess. Yes. This is from Pompeii. That's a panel of the second century. The Neapolitan Museum of Archaeology. You can see fighting between gladiators. Guess where the referee is. In the middle somewhere. That guy over there. I don't know why everybody asked where that guy but actually not. Are those two guys dressed up with Toga? The guys that are more like on the background. But that was a fight that was probably in certain routes. More like MMA fighting but more or less. We can see some mosaics. Which depict referees? I guess it would be quite dangerous to be a referee right? You can risk. They have this stick. Like a boxing fighting. Too much confusion. They didn't strike him? No, no. We were all separated. Fighters. Nightingale. Fighting but with style. So many different kinds. The fisherman for example. The taser. Many many different kind of gladiator. We can see some regional equipment. As I told you this was not a fighting thing. Those guys were private possession of this planista. This manager of the gladiator. So I don't know. You don't want to invest the money not to spend for those guys. For the training, for the food. And also those gladiator were not used to fighting many many times every year. Right. So it was quite an investment to have them trained. And fat. It would be a shame to die. That's why most of the time if the editor, the one that organized the game killed. Or in the fighting one gladiator was killed. Then the editor had to repay back to the planista, the manager, the entire cost of the gladiator. So that's why the mortality rate is much lower than what we imagine. Much lower. 10% in some case. Even low. Quite low. Still not perfect but... Then at some point when the roman empire turned into a Christian Catholic empire, those fighting started to be limited, till the total prohibition. And this was used basically for fighting between animals, exotic animals. But that point the roman empire, especially the western roman empire was already quite poor. Because good part of the remunerative businesses all moved to the eastern part. Even the cavity at some point has been moved to the east, Constantinople. So Rome became an impoverished city. So what today is the moon? Exactly. So the very last fighting organized here was similar to bull fighting, let's say. Like the Spanish Corridor. So from here on the left we can see the quanticostruction materials. And also where we were before. Yeah, we were down here, right? Exactly. Right here. I guess the brick side here is quite new in the sense of perhaps 80 years, 100 years. Yeah, it's 200 years, more or less. First part of the 19th century. I guess it's built to maintain its structural integrity. Exactly. So we can assume it stopped to lose pieces. Because this one of the most fragile parts of the monument that's why you had to wrap those steel chains, columns. That's some serious reinforcements. That's the tufa. This greenish kind of stone. It's volcanic stones. Sometimes it's mixed with concrete for the walls. Are these stones from the region here? Or more like... It's locally sourced. Okay, locally sourced. All of those materials are locally sourced. In the sense locally, like proximity of what? 50 kilometers or... See if... 50, 60 kilometers or less. The Tiburino, the travel team is the one that they purchase a little bit far than the other materials. Because the seven inch of room are made with tufa. For example, the bricks where the clay for the bricks was taken from those cross-divatican areas. There were many, many of those factories over there. Those factories were actually maintained active until a few decades ago. Always has been an area of reproduction, the Vatican area. Pretty important, most beautiful and the most famous service. Here is also where the king of Iida, Mussolini, took those peaches to the people. Church of the Colosseum just underneath this. You can also see the other wing over there. Yeah. Let's see that the color of the clay changed. It's been made into different different times. Okay. Right. And the wind comes. It's like amplifying the sound and everybody could hear without amplifying. When the wind comes, people could hear it. When did? He was talking about when the wind comes. Yeah. People could hear the wind gushing in the yasidium or something. I feel that it's referring to especially middle ages in the Colosseum. Because the Colosseum was, the people forgot what happened in the Colosseum. Even when there was a temple actually. Temple of the God of the Sun. It was circular. So people in the research were very superstitious. And they thought that this place was haunted. Yes, haunted. It was basically a place where you can practice the black magic or there were some spirits living inside here. It was seen as a scary kind of place, the Colosseum. People didn't like it. But then when they started cleaning the Colosseum for this procession people were more keen maybe to explore this procession were made during the Good Friday most of the time. That's why there are those stations those small altars. Which one? You see that there is a altar over there? There are many of those. Just one surprise for historical memory. I mean the white one there? Yes. The bronze cross inside this is here. That was a white healer. The Polish Pope. I'm sorry. As I told you, it was used for many many different kind of things. For example, we found weapons of the Nazis sewer system. It has been a deposit of weapons. For example, when the American people arrived they had to clean up these places. And you notice that there are many graffiti of people. Especially in the ground level. Because before the weapon defenses you can see they got good stepping and the safer. It was booby traps. What is booby trap? Booby trap is like you place a bomb or something else and someone goes in and then you put them in. Ah, okay, they disappear? No, it's like a trap a trap for people. Ah, okay, okay. We're not so many people sleeping here. Then at some point in the 90s we understood that we could simply put a fence, figure out and squeeze the tourists with this. So, that's in the 90s where the story of the Colossium as a tourist attraction started. I also heard that they used to fill up this place with water and then all the sort of sea battle. I'm not sure it's true. We have one recorded now Machia, which is this kind of game. It's a naval battle. You can see from here the production. What? Do that scene? The boats. Here the Velarium, canopy. But we have just one recorded now Machia because Marziale, this famous Roman historian wrote in this book the spectacularies regarding the shows about this this battle, no? The water. But what we think is that this happened just a few times maybe just that time it was very difficult for the Romans to fill up with water, this big, big ampit together. But what we know is that the underground part was unexisting in the the monument that was still not completed, basically. So there was the entire down stage still wasn't there. It was still full-float. So it could fill up with water and both could, you know... It's a sail. Because you need just 1.5m of water so the ship could sail. And up to 10 ships could enter inside the Colosseum. But obviously this was a very costly kind of show. It was also very difficult to organize because to fill up with water, the whole arena they spent between 6 and 8 hours. So it was very long, very costly. And also the Romans didn't like the show so much. The Romans were more a population of land rather than a population of sea. Romans are famous for the legions. Not for the naval battles, let's say. So what we think is that the Domitian is the brother of Tidus. Son of the person who started the construction of the Colosseum from the Flavian family decided to get rid of this show the Colosseum and focus on what the Romans liked the most. Fighting between animals and people. So they decided to build this underground part the down stage of the Colosseum with this system of elevators. That's ingenious. Yeah. Special effects. It's also ingenious to have a sea battle here and I guess they had to use some kind of water hydraulics to fill it up. Because there are many underground rivers that flew under the Colosseum. This was a big lake back in the time. It was. Exactly. So actually this whole area was a little bit lower than the rest of the surrounding area, right? Yeah, it was an artificial lake. You have a picture. The Domus Sara, the house of Nero right here. It was this big artificial lake. Private swimming point of the Amperonero which has been grown. There was a big private swimming pool. It's more than a six olympic couple. There you can have a naval battle, not here. Nice. And then it's been all drawn. This part of the city has been given back to the citizens by this new emperor, this new family which wanted to meet the favor of the population. So that's why he decided to dismantle this big palace giving back to the population this part of land, make this public again and this is a deconstruction of a big, big amphitheater the biggest in the Roman world the biggest ever built. Also for conquering the favor who wanted he wanted the population from his side working class from his side. So he condemned Nero to the Domination of Memoria, raising from the memory. There you can see a forum, a temple of Venus house, they give you the the terrace of the earth and obviously it's very difficult to imagine how this was back in time so that's why I have a... Yeah, I've seen some pictures, it's really hard to imagine. I mean, maybe. So it doesn't look like that. It's hidden there. Right. It's too bad. It's totally gone. The only part which has been preserved is the back of these haps. Yeah, the scupula. Exactly. Because the Christian Catholic Church used this as a garden of this big church in Santa Francesca Romana and that's how at least for example the original paving managed to survive. That's an idea. That's the construction. That's a nice picture. Wow. Not a huge building, never was. Not a huge building, never was. Okay. Okay, let's go down. Let's go here. So, Piatec was the very steep saw. Sorry, I thought you called. Yeah, I'll give you a minute. Let's go. I don't know what to do. Okay, let's go. Okay, let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Okay. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. That's a nice part in my opinion because that's one of the main entrances. Remember when you see the Nancy's door, that door of exit, that is the door of entrance, the door of the trial. So when they start the day inside the Colosseum, the day of game, they may start with a big ceremony, the Pompamagna, no? So like the Super Bowl, more or less. The Perforal, Mars, Beyoncé speaking in Latin, or this kind of stuff. Everybody can hear the emperor and all the spectators, not the citizens of Rome. That's a nice spot because you can realize the size of the Colosseum. I was already impressed. But indeed, you can really see the size from left to right. You can feel that much bigger stadium but still very impressive. I mean, the top of that stage, the weight would have been tremendous. See those big boxes on the top? Those were part of the system for this place. And now we go to finish with the emperor's area. The top level was plastered to go to the bricks. And the paving was made with those bricks, the hearing bone structure, right? Being this part of the rich people, see the marble. This is the retro one. Yeah, but there are some. Yes, importantly, we can see a cross, but it's not the cross. There are some. Channels, and the tufa. The archaeologists start to measure. And there we can see the famous elevator. This is the reproduction made in 2014. Downstairs there? Yeah, with the wood. With the surreal function of the elevator. Yeah, that's good. So are there any tours that show you how to use it? There is a video online. You can see the documentary of this guy making the elevator. And they tried that lifting a she-wolf, symbol of the city. So still impressive. That's the biggest, but there are hundreds of those kind of structures spread around the Europe. Over there, earthsy. Who is it here? You can see what's coming of this enteropon. It was sacred tunnels. Over there. There was a sound. It was the emergency exit of the emperor. He was sitting on the top. Ah, right, so he was sitting right here. Yeah, on the top. He could flee this way. Exactly. Oh, he could enter. Oh, he could enter, yeah. All for one man. Yeah. Not everybody likes the games. For example, Adrian ate the games. But for example, I don't know, the Commodo, the one of the movie gladiator, even fought kind of in the arena. So it was really depending of the emperor, how much he wanted to finance, how much often he wanted this game to be organized. The costume has been maintained active for hundreds of years. It's very difficult to have an average of telling how many days of games they were organized every year. But we can say that at some point of the empire, even 100 days of games every year. So one out of three, games inside the Colosseum. Over here, maybe 60, 70 days. Sweet. That's the last preserved. The god used the 16, the pope prepared this part. This is the last preserved because it's the one that has been exploited the most. All the material of the Colosseum has been used for other purposes. So this part was actually kind of rubble or something. Yeah, exactly. Even because during those processions, normally the pope has the other side of the Colosseum. So he said if you had to take the material out of the monument, better to use this side. Over here there was nothing. He had done the other. Because the other is still used because the road led to San Giannillaturan, if you remember. So sometimes, that's the most important church of Rome. More than St. Peter in the Middle Ages. And so since they used that path for those processions, the pope says never ever take part of the monument from the other side. Use this part. Okay. Now we can have the remaining part of the archaeological area. So that's it for the Colosseum, I guess. Sorry? That's it for the Colosseum. Yeah, I guess that's enough. Yeah, sure. It's also bloody out here. Yeah. Alright, thank you for the tour. Yeah. And on to the next one. Yeah, I will work for you for the next experience. Bye bye. I have like an internal ex...
