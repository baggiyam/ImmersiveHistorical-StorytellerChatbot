 Ancient Greece never existed. It's true, there was no such thing as ancient Greece. Let me show you why this is a fact. This documentary is brought to you for free by the New Historia store. The best in apparel from mythology and the ancient world. Check out the Ancient Greece collection, link in the description. People living in what we call ancient Greece wouldn't have necessarily considered themselves to be Greek. Ancient Greeks spoke the same language, shared a common ancestry, religion and often social structure. They were however very much divided. 80% of the landmess in ancient Greece is rugged mountainous terrain with deep dense valleys. Communicating over mountains is difficult, so natural separation between groups of people developed. This came a fierce sense of individuality and so developed independent city-states or polyus. Over a thousand city-states formed across Greece. Mountains provided natural defensive perimeters, walls were built, invisible borders were set in the surrounding countryside and two major city-states developed, Athens and Sparta. These two cities formed opposing customs so they absolutely did not get along. They were constantly at each other's throats, always at war, but this is not a documentary about war. One similarity that you'll find across all of Greece is the love of leisure. Greeks were notoriously lazy. Aside from mandatory military service, you wouldn't care much for hard work. The problem of labour was solved by domestic helpers. Okay, what's a domestic helper you ask? It's what we're calling the people who are the property of someone else and are forced to work for free. Yes, there is a word for these people. You know it, it rhymes with shave. YouTube really didn't like it when I used the proper S word, so we're going to call them domestic helpers from now on. Domestic helpers would afford you a citizen the luxury of spending your day in the Agora. The Agora. A bustling open marketplace. You could buy meat, fish, vegetables, fruit, pottery, textiles, statues, marble figures, perfume and even a new domestic helper. Whatever you wanted, it's probably sold at the Agora. Shopping isn't all you do here though. The Agora was full of men who would spend their entire day here. Whilst you were chilling out in the Agora, your wife would be at home cooking and looking after the children. More domestic helpers would be working away on your farm whilst you, in the Agora, would engage in significantly more meaningful and productive activity. Gossiping about the weather. Chilling out is the modus operandi. After extensive discourse, the topic of weather inevitably dried up. It would now be time to engage in a political debate. Philosophical conversation is also an option as you'll see in a moment, but for some variation in your loafing about, you definitely want to pass some time attending a theatre show. Shows were held in open air theatres once a month to a packed audience. Whether you are here to enjoy some classic tragedy or comedy, I recommend you arrive to the theatre early. The theatres would be completely full by dawn. Many theatres and Athens held over 10,000 people. Officials sit at the front, blower status people at the back. Again though, most of your time would be spent in the Agora as a man of Greece. There's always something interesting happening here. In 5th century Athens, you'd probably bump into Socrates himself. Rather, he'd bump into you. Socrates accosted anyone who'd listen. In Athens, he'd introduce himself with a single name, Socrates. Outside of Athens though, he'd introduce himself as Socrates, son of Sofronis Kossovalapiki. Man or woman, you typically have a single name, but one name can cause a little confusion. This is why you would also include your father's name and your origins. For Socrates, introducing himself was an inconvenient formality. A necessary step before he starts monologuing about his philosophies without coming up for air. He was well known for sauntering around Athens barefoot in a rough woolen cloak. Not the best fashion model, I would admit, but a reasonable representation of what was worn in ancient Greece. Every clothing was made of singular sheets of fabric draped around the body. Men's would usually be white, women's would be a range of vibrant hues and patterns. So we can see what women wore. Let me introduce you to Socrates' wife. Man, Socrates must be filthy rich, right? Socrates is a philosopher, not the best profession for a high net worth. Change gaps like this were actually commonplace in marriage. I quite like her name, Xanthope. When you combine Xanthos, blonde, and Hippos, horse, you get Xanthope, or blonde horse. Even though dark Mediterranean features were almost universal, Xanthope likely had blonde hair. This is because it was common for Greek women to bleach their hair. They also wore lightening makeup for a fairer appearance. There were certainly expectations placed on both men and women in terms of appearance. For instance, it's imperative that your clothing is the correct length. Too long, and your clothes would get dragged through the mud. Too short, your neighbours would laugh in your face and call you a Spartan thigh flasher. Unlike Socrates, most people wore leather sandals outside of the house. Xanthope's wearing platform shoes for an extra couple of centimetres, and if you look atâ€¦ What is that? Ah, Socrates. Looks like all of this vapid talk of fashion has sent Socrates into a coma. Let's leave the Agora for now, shall we? Before we go, we'll need to visit the Coppola for some new hiking boots. Turns out Socrates is leaving town on a journey to the other side of Greece, and you're divided, so lace up your boots as time for an adventure. Apparently the Olympic Games are on. How exciting the Olympic Games! Unfortunately, Olympia is on the other side of Greece. The way to get around most of the time is walking. We know this because Socrates casually mentions a six day hike from Athens to Olympia. Socrates is a genius, no doubt, but six days? Six bloody days, god. These six days are going to be worse than you could even imagine. First we have the weather. Coastal Greece is hot and dry in summer. In winter there are frequent outbursts of rain, and the mountains even get snowy. There are roads and paths within cities, but outside of the capital, forget about it. This isn't Rome. The Greek landscape is unfriendly and unforgiving to say the least. Not ideal for a casual stroll, let alone a week long walk. So what other options do we have? A horse. Much faster and easier, right? No, I'm sorry, a horse won't work, I'm afraid. Horses are extremely expensive. If you did own a horse though, no one really knew about horseshoes yet, so travelling long distances through mountains is next to impossible anyway. There's also no saddles yet either. This means an uncomfortable ride, and lest you like the feeling of horse vertebrae bouncing between your legs for a week straight, donkeys were common though, certainly much more so than horses. What a donkey ride to Olympia be our best bet. Let's look at our other options. A boat was the way to go when you wanted to travel around the mainland and from coastal town to coastal town. Sailing was unfortunately extremely dangerous. Ship wrecks from erratic storms were far too frequent. To minimise risk you'd avoid sailing in the unsafe seasons. There's an even more serious threat than bad weather though. It's a danger that's always in the back of your mind whenever you board a ship. More terrifying than sharks, even more horrific than the thought of your ship sinking in the middle of the sea. Your biggest hazard when sailing in ancient Greece was pirates. Pirates raided merchant ships, but they would also capture anyone on board and sell them as domestic helpers. You know all factors considered, walking is probably the best option. We'll have to trek through the day and stop by and in for the night. Socrates plans on leaving for Olympia tomorrow morning. He didn't say what time though. Socrates didn't make a mistake here. There was no accurate way of telling time other than with a sundial. When your main focus in life is looping about in the Agora, measuring time is not a priority. Dawn, midday and dusk serve most purposes for meetings and time telling. You've had some time to sleep on Socrates' invite to the Olympic Games and you just remembered something deeply disturbing about him. Socrates is notoriously terrible with navigation. Believe me, you do not want to get lost on your travels. Being lost in the mountains with Socrates chewing your ear off about politics is excruciating, sure, but this is nothing compared to what could happen if you stray from your path. Whilst currently there's peace, there's still a bitter rivalry between city states. Individual polyists don't take well to foreigners such as yourself. You see each Greek state considers themselves to be culturally superior. So if the North Star leads you on Socrates' astray and you find yourself in the middle of Sparta, please don't get caught. Just like the pirates, Spartans won't hesitate to sell you as a domestic helper. This trip to Olympia is sounding more and more dangerous by the second. Alright, how about we do this? Why don't we step back and take an objective unbiased look at the situation? We have an arduous six-day hike in unpredictable weather through mountains accompanied by a man who easily gets lost and will incessantly monologue about politics the entire time with the constant looming threat of being captured and sold into domestic helpery by Spartan savages. All this for the opportunity to watch butt naked oiled Greek men run around a dirt track. Well, thanks for the invite Socrates, but I think we'll have to pass on the Olympics this year. Hey, there's always another one. How about we spend the day on the farm instead? Agriculture in the classical world was prevalent. Egypt, Greece and Rome all had farm-related work as the majority vocation. In Greece, more than half of all citizens were connected with agriculture in some way. If you wanted to make some decent coin, animal rearing was pretty profitable. Cows and sheep are rare. Your livestock would mainly be goats. Don't like goats? No problems. Grow some olives. Olives weren't exactly easy to grow, but they were an essential commodity. The olive tree produced for Greece like nothing else. Olive oil for lamps, essence for pharmaceutical applications. Wood for fires, wood for building houses, wood for building ships, leaves for crowns, leaves for decoration, and last but not least, a tasty nutritious fruit. Let's say you don't like goats and you don't like olives. Of course saying you don't like olives is ridiculous. All Greeks love olives. But what else could you grow? Greeks love wine. Grapes. Grapes are the answer. You'd plant your grapevines in uniform rows. In between your rows of grapes, you'd grow corn, vegetables and fruit. A nice little supplement to your grape growing empire. I'm going to skip over farming as I've covered it already in my daily life in ancient Egypt documentary. The farming process in Greece, Egypt and Rome was relatively similar. If the idea of working on a farm isn't few at all, you could become a manual labourer. A carpenter, painter, sculptor or blacksmith. Ship builders were always in high demand. If you don't like working with your hands, you could become a merchant, importing and exporting essential and luxury goods. Being a merchant was risky though. Ships were frequently boarded and looted by pirates. Sail on the wrong day and there goes your merchandise. Ah, there's another job. Become a pirate. Not exactly an honest living, but if you want to get rich quick, don't mind a bit of risk and lack a moral compass. Eh, why not? A pirate's life could be for you. During the times of maritime infancy, ships sailed close to the coast. Enimble pirate ships hid in the rugged mountainous inlets, waiting for their next victims. Bulky, slow merchant vessels full of merchandise to pilfer. Pirates were a real menace to merchants and travellers, especially as trade routes expanded and Greece became more dependent on the sea for travel and trade. Throughout the history of sailing in the Mediterranean, pirates were always a present threat. But raids always ended badly for merchants. At best, you'd lose all of your merchandise. At worst, you would lose your life. Perhaps a fate worse than death, pirates would sell you abroad as a domestic helper. That farm life is sounding a little more tempting now, isn't it? If you're part of the minority that insists on holding a legitimate job but have no desire to work on a farm or as a merchant, there aren't a lot of respectable career options going. You could try your luck at fishing. Maybe set up a temporary booth in the Agora to sell your goods. Small manufacturing operations existed, if you could be a cobbler or a potter. You generally wouldn't do much work here though. As the business owner, you would have very little to do with the business itself, especially as the operation grew. Many businesses were often run exclusively by highly skilled domestic helpers. You'd seldom find a Greek citizen who'd want to be an employee anyway. Employees could be laid off at any moment and they had to endure the indignity of taking orders from another citizen. The best job for those who want to be employed was offered by the state. Rowing for Athens was a common job. There were tens of thousands of rowers in the fleet of Athens. Your pay would be one truckma per day, the average salary at the time. Above all, most Greeks took great pride in being their own man. This meant not being reliant upon employment from another individual. In your mind, to work for someone else would be almost worse than being a domestic helper. Domestic helpers at least enjoyed some employment security. Plus why would you work for someone else when you can get a domestic helper to do the same job for free? Really, domestic helpers were one of the main reasons Greeks was able to thrive. It was an unfortunate everyday reality for many domestic helpers. Almost every household had a domestic helper. Rich houses, poor houses, domestic helpers were always present. Male domestic helpers labored and guarded the house. Female domestic helpers cooked, cleaned and cared for your children. The numbers of domestic helpers in Greek cities were astounding. Some figures approached nearly half of the entire population of Apollis. Domestic helpers were bought and sold at markets like any other commodity. The value of a domestic helper was based on their abilities and skills. An unskilled domestic helper cost around 200 truckma. Skilled domestic helpers cost many multiples more. Fortunately not all masters were terrible to their domestic helpers. I'm getting really tired of saying that. Some masters allowed domestic helpers to buy their freedom. Many domestic helpers actually lived decent lives in nice houses. All over Greece people lived in properties like this. The richer you were the more rooms and furniture you had. The poorer citizens lived in one room houses that were separated by makeshift partitions. Interior walls were covered with a coat of plaster. Northe Athenians had their plaster walls painted with frescoes. Floors were composed of compressed earth or clay. They were sometimes covered in animal skins or reed matting. Fourth century BC onward you'd start to see more intricately designed interiors using mosaics or small patterned pebbles. During winter windows are boarded up with wood to keep out the rain. Just like in Egypt wood was expensive. This meant that most houses were poorly furnished. You may own a basic table and chairs but really houses weren't full of stuff like ours are today. The Peloponnesian war was spreading across Greece and Athens was about to be invaded. Athenian farmers gathered all their valuables and they evacuated but there was something extraordinarily valuable they simply could not leave behind. As the Athenian farmers evacuated the city they made sure to take their wooden doors and shutters with them. Athens was not only notorious for how much they valued their wooden doors, they were also well known for the crappy quality of their houses. You won't believe this. The word Athenians commonly used for burglar translates to wall digger. Why is this? Well, the walls of most Athenian houses were lazily built with irregularly shaped stones all haphazardly placed on top of each other. Sometimes they didn't even bother baking the mud bricks, they just slapped a thin layer of lime over it and called it good. These Athenian houses were so poorly constructed, burglars would break in by kicking a hole through the wall. Once they raided your property they'd exit through the front door and of course on the way out they would take the front door with them. Even though houses were shoddily built, the home was a valued place for family. The word Ecos translates to household. A household included husbands, wives, children, grandparents, siblings and all the domestic helpers. Everyone lived under the same roof. Rules were clearly defined, the oldest male headed the household, sons took on their father's profession, daughters and wives cleaned and cooked. Good Greek food isn't nearly as exciting as contemporary Greek cuisine. You'd eat some light meals during the day and then a big meal at sunset. So what's on the menu? Olive oil of course, lots of olive oil. Grain was ubiquitous, it was the majority of daily colouric intake. Vegetables were also a part of most meals, the types of vegetables were similar to what we eat today. According to the sophisticated Athenians, consuming milk products was simply barbaric. Dairy was undesirable unless you didn't have any other choice. Also not on the menu is meat. Red meat was rare. Commonly consumed meats were game, poultry and fish, Athens was well known for its anchovies and sardines. Water was the second choice to wine. If you don't like wine, you're more of a beer drinker. Barbarian, only barbarians drink beer. Sophisticated Athenians drink wine and a whole lot of it. Of course you can only drink so much wine, so the solution to achieve quantity was to dilute it with water. If you were lucky you'd have a water well outside of your house, if you didn't have a well your domestic helper would travel to a public drinking fountain, fill a container and carry the water all the way back home. Dining for the rich was a different experience entirely. The rich would host an extravagant party called a symposium. Guests lie on couches for a substantial three course meal. After the meal acrobats, musicians and dancing women show up. The men attending would talk politics and of course gossip about the weather. No respectable women allowed. Here's a succinct summary of women and ancient Greece. The relation of male to female is by nature a relation of superior to inferior and ruler to ruled. That is a quote by a famous philosopher. Not Socrates, but arguably one of history's greatest minds. Whose quote is this? Yeah, Aristotle said that. Women in ancient Greece really didn't have any rights. Like domestic helpers they couldn't vote and they couldn't become citizens. They were rarely allowed to leave a house and when they did they had to be accompanied by a male relative. Women were not permitted to buy or sell land. You could inherit property but even then it was managed by a legal guardian, a brother, father or husband. No matter their age a woman was always under the control of a man in Greece. Girls entered into arranged marriages when they were a young teenager and they were expected to provide an heir as soon as possible. The greatest honor you could provide your polis and husband was giving birth to a child. A male child of course. Male heirs were always the goal. There was a lot of pressure on women in regards to children. Childbirth was like playing Russian roulette because of the high maternal death rates. Whilst women died in large numbers during labour, death was unfortunately common for all age groups and all demographics. No mortality was no surprise with regular instances of rickets, sineam-eer and chickenpox. Children and teenagers died of malaria, tuberculosis, mumps, measles, leprosy and whooping cough. Women died from disease. Men died at war. Commoners died from malnutrition and natural disaster. Earthquakes and cramps poorly constructed apartment blocks called sinikeiae were total death traps. It also didn't help that these buildings were always catching on fire. Crowded cities like Athens were ankle deep in filth. There was no waste disposal system, so rubbish piled up on the streets. These conditions attracted mosquitoes, rats and flies which brought in the plague. Disease was rampant behind the full city walls of Athens. Their worst epidemic was in 430 BC. Nearly a third of the entire Athenian population was wiped out. What caused this plague is blatantly obvious. It wasn't the severe issues with water hygiene and sanitation, no. The worst epidemic in Athens was caused by spartan scum poisoning the water supply. That's what these sophisticated Athenians proclaimed anyway. The ancient world had little comprehension of disease transmission. There was no knowledge of germs, so I guess it's only logical sparta would be responsible for such shameless sabotage. Death was something that was always present in the ancient world. When someone died in Greece, there was a common process that was followed. There were no hospitals, so you'd always die with your family by your side. On your demise you'd be stuck in limbo between life and death, trapped between two worlds, wandering around for an eternity. Your family would help you go to Hades through a proper burial. I did a short documentary about Hades, check it out if you're interested in mythology. Speaking of the gods, almost everyone in ancient Greece was religious. Almost every facet of a Greek's life could be related back to a god in some way. What we call mythology was their religion. Greek religion is far too vast a topic to address here, I'm sure you'd agree. Man, Greek mythology is phenomenal, so look out for more on this channel. If you're not subscribed, what are you doing?
